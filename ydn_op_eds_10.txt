It’s hard not to feel like Yale is a magical place as a first year. If our gothic castles, mazes of underground tunnels and secret passageways didn’t make you feel like you were at Hogwarts, then you probably didn’t explore campus enough. If the professors and famous speakers who frequent campus every week didn’t seem like wizards to you, then you probably didn’t understand just how talented they were.
But that magic fades as we get older. As we get accustomed to fancy buildings and visits from presidential candidates, it becomes easier to notice the problems that make campus feel a little less special. The same students who bemoan the student income contribution and the lack of adequate mental health counseling on campus today were once bright-eyed first-years, ones who sat in the front row when Howard Dean debated the Yale Political Union.
And yet somehow, despite all of Yale’s issues, we get some of that first-year magic back by the end of our senior year. We realize how strange it is that our campus controversies make the pages of the New York Times. We regain appreciation for the major politicians, economists and thinkers who take the time to give us feedback on our essays, most of which we threw together after a night at Woads. We dread leaving a place where late-night conversations about sports are just as common as arguments about geopolitics.
So which is it? Is Yale magical or isn’t it? I’ve found it difficult to reconcile all the memories I’ve cherished here with all the problems that plague our campus. But I think I’ve found a way to do so. Regardless of what our majors may have been, the books we read and the ideas we studied were exciting. And that’s where the magic is. What we should admire about our college experience is information and knowledge in itself — not the medium that delivered it to us. Yale brought us together and made it possible for us to have important conversations and arguments. For that, I am grateful.
But Yale itself is not magical – it’s the world that Yale taught us about that is. The theorems in our math textbooks and anecdotes from our history classes are what are magical. The odd intellectual niches of each member of the Class of 2018 are what are magical. Hell, even the drunken conversations we’ve all had with one another at 2 a.m. are magical in their own way. Yale is just a collection of institutions, flawed as they may be, that gave us a glimpse of those magical moments.
Our generation faces a laundry list of problems that we’ve all heard about by now: rising income inequality, the effects of climate change, gun violence and so many more. But whatever the problem du jour may be tomorrow, let’s not forget that we still have stories to hear, laughter to share and communities to enjoy. The joy we find in these aspects of our lives are why we care about solving any of these problems to begin with. We (hopefully) studied topics that brought us happiness and piqued our interest precisely because we are excited about the wonders of the world that we live in.
Commencement columns and speeches almost always follow the same formula: They begin with an anecdote illustrating how grateful we ought to be for the privilege of attending Yale and go on to explain that this privilege confers upon us a moral obligation to change the world for the better. That’s all true, but I think we have a far less didactic reason to help. The world is a magical place. Shouldn’t we keep it that way?
To participate in commencement — to commence — is to reflect on the passage of time. 
Commencement alludes to a beginning, yet graduation marks an ending. On this day, past and future collapse into the present, pausing time itself. 
As I reminisce on the last four years, I think of all the moments I wished I could hold onto forever. The handshakes, the hugs, the two-hour lunch in the dining hall, the two-hour cry on Old Campus. The Saybrook Strip. The last song at Woads before the lights buzz on. But despite my best efforts, such moments elude my grasp. I regret that those moments are ephemeral, but I also recognize that they are no more ephemeral than life itself.
What, then, will be our relationship to our past — that is to say, to each other? The saddest thing, I think, would be to cling on to some bygone vision of our “bright college years,” watching each other grow into parodies of ourselves.
While the past may be a source of comfort and familiarity, it can also be a specter, haunting us with all the “what ifs” and “back in the days.” At points of transition, the temptation is always to long for the past. Even old resentments can serve a useful psychological function, rehearsing emotional scripts which write out the unknown.
But for the Class of 2018, I hope commencement will, instead, be a moment for reinvention — an opportunity to learn, grow and develop beyond the proverbial Yale bubble. Or, as the keynote speaker put it at our freshman assembly, all those years ago in Woolsey Hall — a chance to change.
Now, reinvention is hard. As we form new connections between neurons in our brains, our old synapses literally degenerate. At the cellular level, the death of our old selves is not merely metaphorical, it is physical. Yet, unless we embrace the work of reinvention and craft new lives for ourselves, we will perpetually linger in the twilight zone of nostalgia. The wistful past will become a forlorn present, and then return as a dread of the future.
Rather than refusing to leave Yale behind, let’s relish the fact that there is a part of Yale that will never leave us. In my time here, I have been moved by the passion, transformed by the humanity and challenged by the intellect on this campus. Together, we will carry the confidence we have gained at Yale, and boldly go where none of us have gone before. 
To my friends — I want you to know that I will always be there for you, as you begin new jobs or enroll in graduate school, settle into new cities or move back home, start families or break up with lovers. I will gently nudge you when I think you have strayed, but I will also respect the integrity of your life decisions, even when I disagree with them. For the rest of our lives, be they long or short, I will celebrate the people you become, even as I cherish the people you once were. And I will do all this without resentment or envy, but with the knowledge — though not the expectation — that you will do the same for me. 
At Yale, we say that the days are long, but the weeks are short. The festivities of commencement weekend have been long, but the past four years have been short — and how I have wished that today could last just a bit longer. Just as we are mortal — my first-year self could pull an all-nighter or chug 5 beers and still function the next day; no longer — so too is our time together finite. 
But this is not the end. In the years that follow, there will be class reunions to attend — and to miss. Baby showers. Weddings. Visits to hospitals (but hopefully not to prison). Funerals. On each of these occasions, I hope we will unpause rather than replay the time we have shared, just as we did. Today.  
“If the past is not to bind us, where can duty lie?” – George Eliot, 1860
When war broke out in the spring of 1861, Uriah Parmelee was a sophomore at Yale. Having grown up on a farm near Guilford, Connecticut, he became an abolitionist in his youth.
Without a second thought, Parmelee dropped out of Yale to join the 6th New York Cavalry. Proclaiming that he was “more of an abolitionist than ever—right up to the handle,” Parmelee fought with bravery and purpose in many of the Civil War’s bloodiest battles. At Chancellorsville he was promoted to the 1st Connecticut Cavalry, and for his actions at the battle of Ashland he gained the rank of captain.
In the sort of tragic irony that colored so much of the nineteenth century, Parmelee was killed eight days before the end of the war. On April 2, 1865 he died at the Battle of Five Forks outside of Petersburg, Virginia. It was the last major battle of the war; eight days later, Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse. To the bitter end, Parmelee had fought for both liberty and the Union. 
What lessons can we learn from men like Parmelee who, as the cenotaph on Beinecke Plaza reads, “gave their lives that freedom might not perish from the earth”? What can Parmelee’s departure from Yale and premature death teach us, students lucky enough to have made it to graduation? At the very least, Parmelee’s legacy should remind us that there is more to a meaningful life than what is found in books and classrooms.
Parmelee wrote many letters to his family from the front, and the story those letters tell should be a familiar one to Yalies, even in 2018. His is a tale of bright-eyed idealism in a world of hatred and bloodshed, of disillusionment with the government’s motives, and of a young Yale student struggling to live by his principles.
Through Parmelee, we can chart the progress of abolitionism in a young mind. At the outset, he believed the Civil War was caused by slavery and would bring about slavery’s destruction. But in 1861, President Lincoln wanted a war of limited aims, and Parmelee grew frustrated at the Union’s reluctance to make eliminating slavery an explicit goal. “I thought that the progress of events must surely bring about universal Emancipation,” he wrote to his mother. He believed that if the army’s principles didn’t change, his conscience would require him to summon “the moral courage to desert it.”
History offers no easy idols, however, and Parmelee is no exception. As he wrote: “Things appear mixed in this world, and motives and actions are not as clearly defined as we might wish them.” Despite his staunch abolitionism, Parmelee had an African-American servant during the war, and seems to have felt no sense of contradiction in this. “I have a little n••••r to wait on me,” he wrote. “How much easier it is to have a little n•g to take your extra steps for you than it is to do all yourself.”
By the summer of 1863, Parmelee’s spirits had been rejuvenated by the Emancipation Proclamation. “I do not intend to shirk now that there is really something to fight for — I mean Freedom,” he wrote. “So then I am willing to remain and endure whatever may fall to my share.”
There is a deep pathos to Parmelee’s story, an impression from reading him that he understood the sacrifice he was making, that he knew the arc of history would bend toward justice only if he placed himself — along with thousands of young men like him — before its altar. 
Students like Parmelee are not so very different from those today; while not all Yalies have been given the chance to enlist in the Union army, when a moment of great national significance passes before us, it is our duty to take part, to endure whatever may fall to our share.
In the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who, two decades later, reflected on the generation of young college students whose lives were caught up in the Civil War, “in our youth our hearts were touched with fire. It was given to us to learn at the outset that life is a profound and passionate thing.” Let us hope that we may someday learn the same, if we haven’t already. 
In our youth, then, we must take up the call of public service and self-sacrifice, taking our places, contradictions and all, in the register of the past. Stop, before you leave campus, in the rotunda of Woolsey Hall. Look at the names, then give Uriah Parmelee’s a rub for good measure.
The closing of our “bright college years” is a time of thank yous. We write letters to professors who have helped us think better. We cook dinner with our closest friends and remember how we laughed and learned and loved, trying to hold onto each other into the future. We lounge in our colleges, thanking the people who have made them feel like home. 
In trying to find the words to thank my parents and my grandmother, I find myself suddenly mute. I am not alone in this quandary, as none of us know how to thank the people who love us so much that our accomplishments feel like their own. They are our parents and grandparents, our siblings and mentors, and they have loved us better than we know.
In part, our “thank yous” must be practical ones. Thank you for our educations. Thank you for feeding us, for flying us home, for talking through our frustrations. Thank you for letting us study what we wanted. Thank you for raising an eyebrow at pictures you wish you hadn’t seen, and thank you for knowing that we would turn out alright. Thank you for trusting us with autonomy, for letting us grow.
This thanks must also extend to the future, as we will continue to rely on the people we love. We have been necessarily independent at Yale as we develop the parts of ourselves that can only grow away from home. But even though we are no longer in school, we still need to be parented, and we still need advice. Some of our questions will be practical. How does one buy a car? How should I quit my first job — and how should I find another? When should I get my first mammogram? Some of our questions will be much harder. How do we navigate differences — religious, financial, emotional — within a marriage? How do we think about how to name our first child? How do we help our guardians age, hurt and mourn as the people they love start aging, too? These future questions are the things we do not even know we will one day need to ask. And so we thank them all the same, knowing that we will always be their children even if we one day have children of our own.
But this ineffable thanks is still rooted in the present. It is the gratitude of a lifetime. For how do we thank the people who have loved and will love us, unequivocally and unconditionally, for the whole of our lives? For the big things — life, sustenance, education — but for the small things, too. For willingly changing their entire lives to bring us into the world, and for continuing to push us further and further out into its embrace. For literacy, for thoughtfulness. For teaching us to keep talking even when a man interrupts. For sitting down to family dinner whenever we could.  For teaching us how to apologize and for also teaching us that love forgives.
I do not know how to say thank you for that which was unquestioningly given, other than to acknowledge that I do not know the immensity of the sacrifice. Is it possible to thank our guardians for spending every day with us as the first thing in their thoughts in the morning, and the last thing in their thoughts at night? How do you thank the people who you love so much that you’ve never questioned that you’ll probably be buried next to them, that you’ll go through the hardest parts of life with them? That when you lose each other, you’ll always have broken off a part of yourself?
There is one obvious way, which is by making something of the love that we have received and to make use of all the ways we have developed. It is to make our lives meaningful and full of love. That is, to have a career that fulfills us, to have friends who we love, to have our own families one day — whatever that may be. Our future happiness is, itself, the thanks.
But, as with all things, my mother has already shown me the right thing to do. Four years ago, as a “going away present,” she gave me a mug. “Call your mother” the mug said — nagged, really — so that every time I made myself tea in the mornings, I’d be reminded to pick up the phone.This is a silly example, but perhaps also the most essential. There is nothing superficial, I’ve recently been told, about the small things, and the best way to thank someone you love is to make them smile in surprise. So call your mom. Call your dad. Call your grandma. Call whomever is that person, the person who parented you, loved you, guided you and challenged you. I don’t know how to say “thank you” better than to do so often and to do so simply. That’s the best way to thank the people we love most in the world for giving us everything that we are.
One of my favorite things about Yale has been watching my friends obsess over their passions: bold start-up ideas, intimidatingly complex research projects, exercise regimens required for military service. When working on these projects, their eyes visibly light up. I consider each of these pursuits a “10 out of 10 opportunity,” the type that truly inspires and can’t be turned down.
As an undergraduate, I pursued my own 10/10 opportunity during my junior year, when I was the editor in chief of this very paper. That meant from 6:30 p.m. until 3 a.m., five nights per week, I was working away at the Yale Daily News building on York Street. 
People often ask me whether such an intense time commitment took away from my college experience. Quite the opposite. I loved editing the News because I believe in this paper and the students who make it.
Other people ask whether it’s my nature to be so busy. Again, the answer is no. I just chose to prioritize an especially exciting opportunity over my personal life for a specific period of time, as many of my classmates did while here.
Editing the News taught me important lessons about leadership, commitment and my own limitations. One of those lessons — the one that feels most relevant to commencement — centers on how I plan to balance my adult life: by prioritizing work when presented with a 10/10 opportunity, and by slowing down when such an opportunity does not exist.  
While at Yale, 10/10 opportunities have looked different for each of us: directing a play, competing for a spot in the starting lineup, leading a campus movement. What ties these experiences together is that, while pursuing them, our passions and hopes took over. For me, that’s what editing the News felt like.
But those moments only come by every so often. And when they don’t — when 10/10 opportunities are nowhere to be found — I have learned while in college how important it is to pump the breaks.
A trap that many Yale students have fallen into, myself included, is the feeling that if we’re not working on something, then we’re doing something wrong. That’s how I felt during my first year here. But my time with the News taught me just how wrongheaded that attitude was.
Once my tenure as EIC came to an end, I instinctively filled my time with a random assortment of tasks. Going from editing the News — a job that meant so much to me — to artificial busyness was at first rather depressing but ultimately clarifying. After a few weeks, I learned to say no to nearly all of the responsibilities that I encountered. Yes, I still pursued the occasional 10/10 opportunity, but by and large I saw my friends, did my readings and slept. I now consider my senior year to be the most personally rewarding of my time at Yale, largely because of the friendships I strengthened over the past nine months.
My point here is two-fold. First, I disagree with people who say that work should never take over your life. If you have a 10/10 opportunity, go all in. Those moments are fleeting and should be taken advantage of. 
But I also disagree with people who let work dominate their lives by default. Work can’t always be so exceptional. That’s why it’s called work. If you lack a 10/10 opportunity, by no means abandon what you’re doing. Just move a bit more slowly.
I am still struggling to get this middle ground just right: diving into 10/10 opportunities, and prioritizing my personal life when such an opportunity does not exist. It’s a hard balance to strike, partially because it is not always clear what, exactly, qualifies as a 10/10 opportunity, at least to me.
As we enter adulthood, none of us should be afraid to pour ourselves into our work at times of particular inspiration. At the same time, none of us should be afraid to focus on ourselves when our work just isn’t all that great. I encourage my fellow graduates to try to live both of these lives: to find fulfillment both professionally and personally. We may not be able to have it all, but that doesn’t mean we can’t try.
To the prefrosh:
As I write this, carefree music is wafting through Cross Campus, overlapping with notes of laughter and undertones of conversation. To my left, a circle of students on wooden chairs bursts into a round of applause, wrapping up a class for the semester. To my right, a wide-eyed student sloughs off his puffer jacket, giving it a new purpose as a makeshift picnic blanket. As spring emerges, so have Yale students — slowing their typically brisk paces, allowing themselves to steep in the warm embrace of a new season. As I gaze upon the scene before me, I watch passersby smile to themselves. Some even make eye contact, as if silently asking me to share in the beauty of this moment with them.
As an opinion columnist, I typically try to offer constructive commentary on the darker parts of our Bright College Years. From alcoholic exclusion to sexual assault to the closing of Commons, I joke with my friends that “every two weeks, I have to figure out what I’m angry about.” However, none of those criticisms are indicative of the general way most people here feel about Yale. As many of you near the May 1st deadline, you may be deciding which school is right for you — the worthiest of the currency that is time, and what makes Yale special.
About eight months ago, I sat on the plush grass behind Ezra Stiles College and wrote what I hoped to get out of my first year here at Yale with my first-year counselor group. After writing our anonymous notes, we scrambled them and passed them around in a circle. The one I ended up with said, “A place that feels like home, a community that offers hope.”
While you will receive an excellent education no matter where you choose to attend, not all colleges will feel like home. Yale is an oddly friendly and happy place, an island of idealism in a troubled world, offering blessed respite for four years. In the mere span of a year, it has become a place where I can walk down the street to a chorus of hellos and beaming smiles, and walk into a dining hall alone, yet emerge with a company of friends.
This isn’t to say that Yale is perfect, or that everyone here wakes up with a smile on their face — far from it. There are days when you’ll feel swamped with assignments, and when the freezing wind will chill you to the bone. But people at Yale buy into a culture of inclusivity and community: We play as a team. When you fall down, we’ll help you back up. We celebrate everyone’s quirks rather than shutting them down — whether it’s a love for public transit, a passion for minority issues or your admiration of calculus.
But what I find most endearing about Yale is the diversity of interactions I’ve found here: ones that have shattered all the stereotypes and cliques I used to see in high school. Before you even arrive on campus, your college dean will sit down with your housing form and handpick a suite for you, one with people who you would probably not befriend otherwise. From them alone, you’ll learn a wealth of lessons. You may find yourself attending fine arts performances to watch their newly choreographed Broadway piece, or taking up a magazine piece on recognition for Native American and indigenous languages, as I did after hearing my suitemate Gabriella’s story about growing up on a reservation in Montana. Their lives will begin to blend with yours, expanding your horizons in broad strokes and helping you see this campus from angles you never could have imagined.
One-fourth of my time on this campus is up, a fact that becomes more real to me as I write notes and well-wishes to graduating seniors, many of whom have loved me beyond compare. But as they leave, we will welcome you with open arms, much like the ones that helped us move in our suitcases on the first day and embraced us during times of hardship. I told you earlier that Yale is an oddly friendly place, a fact buffered by how much we love our first-year students.
As the seasons begin to change once again, campus will too. Soon, spring will fade into summer, and you will begin to pack up all you have ever known. Rest assured, regardless of how daunting Yale may seem, that you are in for the best years of your life — these “Bright College Years.” From all of us, welcome home.
Best,
Kat
The student income contribution isn’t a lot of money. If you deduct “estimated personal expenses” from your financial aid award letter, the number will come out to $630 for first years and students with no expected parental contribution, who are usually the focus of discourse. Campus minimum wage is $12.75 and it isn’t particularly hard to find a job that pays more. Even at the lowest wage, it comes out to about 50 hours a year, or less than an hour a week. The rest of one’s hours of employment can go to personal expenses, not greedy daddy Yale.
I am a low income student, a First-Year Scholars at Yale alumnus, with a blue-collar father, a huge scholarship and an underperforming high school. I am also a busy student. This semester, I am taking five reading-heavy seminars. All take attendance and expect plenty of participation, so I can’t feasibly skip or arrive unprepared. When I’m not in class, I have a leadership role with the Yale Debate Association and go to tournaments. I’m also a varsity athlete.
And I have a campus job. Actually, I have two. I usually work between seven and ten hours a week at the Yale College Dean’s Office or as a sports reporter. I make good money, and only a small portion of it goes to Yale.
What might surprise some readers is that I do not feel oppressed or pressured by this situation. While everyone struggles with procrastination, and I am no exception, I have never felt that I could not get my work done.
I recognize that this sounds like I am bragging. I am not. I have had struggles too, and they are more demoralizing than working a campus job. I was not prepared for Yale. For me, it was a tremendous struggle overcoming my background. In my first year on campus, my roommate called me ignorant for saying “taller than me” instead of “taller than I.” In my math class, I sat silently and then wrangled the problem sets on my own because I didn’t know that it was all right to see the peer tutor. In high school, I was the peer tutor. I had no idea what I was supposed to do for the summer, so I ended up hanging posters and distributing keys. If I had come from another family, perhaps my experience would have been different. If I had had a mentor to guide me, perhaps I would have done better.
Cash wouldn’t have helped me. I bought my textbooks for nearly nothing on the “Free and For Sale” Facebook group and from the YHHAP Book Sale. I worked a little to pay for my expenses and that small sum Yale expected. I’m moving off campus next year, which should save me a significant amount of money.
Yale has numerous centers for marginalized groups on campus: La Casa Cultural, the Women’s Center and the LGBTQ Co-op, to name a few. There is no center for low-income or first generation students, and I think that is really a shame. The Dean’s Office has recently launched a program called the First Generation and Low Income Ambassadors. I am one of them. We direct students to services such as the winter clothing fund and produce a newsletter for students who share our backgrounds. While this is a step forward, we have no physical location, no peer liasons and limited funding.
Eliminating the student income contribution would cost a massive amount of money. While a few hundred dollars go directly to Yale, another $3,000 or so is estimated for personal expenses and travel, which is, at least in my case, a massive overestimation. Those who oppose the contribution usually want both eliminated. Given that approximately half of undergrads are on financial aid, that comes out to millions of dollars a year. For me, I would rather have a center created to advocate for our needs and provide targeted services to students of my background. With more money, I might buy my textbooks new instead of used and potentially go out to dinner. My life wouldn’t change that much. A center could help students from my background navigate Yale and form a more coherent community in order to ultimately achieve more success.
While the student income contribution is a focus of campus discourse, I believe that the money required to eliminate it could be better spent establishing such a center. The number of hours we are expected to work are absurdly low for the amount of controversy, and a center would better serve the needs of students like me.
It’s hard not to feel like Yale is a magical place as a first year. If our gothic castles, mazes of underground tunnels and secret passageways didn’t make you feel like you were at Hogwarts, then you probably didn’t explore campus enough. If the professors and famous speakers who frequent campus every week didn’t seem like wizards to you, then you probably didn’t understand just how talented they were.
But that magic fades as we get older. As we get accustomed to fancy buildings and visits from presidential candidates, it becomes easier to notice the problems that make campus feel a little less special. The same students who bemoan the student income contribution and the lack of adequate mental health counseling on campus today were once bright-eyed first-years, ones who sat in the front row when Howard Dean debated the Yale Political Union.
And yet somehow, despite all of Yale’s issues, we get some of that first-year magic back by the end of our senior year. We realize how strange it is that our campus controversies make the pages of the New York Times. We regain appreciation for the major politicians, economists and thinkers who take the time to give us feedback on our essays, most of which we threw together after a night at Woads. We dread leaving a place where late-night conversations about sports are just as common as arguments about geopolitics.
So which is it? Is Yale magical or isn’t it? I’ve found it difficult to reconcile all the memories I’ve cherished here with all the problems that plague our campus. But I think I’ve found a way to do so. Regardless of what our majors may have been, the books we read and the ideas we studied were exciting. And that’s where the magic is. What we should admire about our college experience is information and knowledge in itself — not the medium that delivered it to us. Yale brought us together and made it possible for us to have important conversations and arguments. For that, I am grateful.
But Yale itself is not magical – it’s the world that Yale taught us about that is. The theorems in our math textbooks and anecdotes from our history classes are what are magical. The odd intellectual niches of each member of the Class of 2018 are what are magical. Hell, even the drunken conversations we’ve all had with one another at 2 a.m. are magical in their own way. Yale is just a collection of institutions, flawed as they may be, that gave us a glimpse of those magical moments.
Our generation faces a laundry list of problems that we’ve all heard about by now: rising income inequality, the effects of climate change, gun violence and so many more. But whatever the problem du jour may be tomorrow, let’s not forget that we still have stories to hear, laughter to share and communities to enjoy. The joy we find in these aspects of our lives are why we care about solving any of these problems to begin with.

To participate in commencement — to commence — is to reflect on the passage of time. 
Commencement alludes to a beginning, yet graduation marks an ending. On this day, past and future collapse into the present, pausing time itself. 
As I reminisce on the last four years, I think of all the moments I wished I could hold onto forever. The handshakes, the hugs, the two-hour lunch in the dining hall, the two-hour cry on Old Campus. The Saybrook Strip. The last song at Woads before the lights buzz on. But despite my best efforts, such moments elude my grasp. I regret that those moments are ephemeral, but I also recognize that they are no more ephemeral than life itself.
What, then, will be our relationship to our past — that is to say, to each other? The saddest thing, I think, would be to cling on to some bygone vision of our “bright college years,” watching each other grow into parodies of ourselves.
While the past may be a source of comfort and familiarity, it can also be a specter, haunting us with all the “what ifs” and “back in the days.” At points of transition, the temptation is always to long for the past. Even old resentments can serve a useful psychological function, rehearsing emotional scripts which write out the unknown.
But for the Class of 2018, I hope commencement will, instead, be a moment for reinvention — an opportunity to learn, grow and develop beyond the proverbial Yale bubble. Or, as the keynote speaker put it at our freshman assembly, all those years ago in Woolsey Hall — a chance to change.
Now, reinvention is hard. As we form new connections between neurons in our brains, our old synapses literally degenerate. At the cellular level, the death of our old selves is not merely metaphorical, it is physical. Yet, unless we embrace the work of reinvention and craft new lives for ourselves, we will perpetually linger in the twilight zone of nostalgia.

And I will do all this without resentment or envy, but with the knowledge — though not the expectation — that you will do the same for me. 
At Yale, we say that the days are long, but the weeks are short. The festivities of commencement weekend have been long, but the past four years have been short — and how I have wished that today could last just a bit longer. Just as we are mortal — my first-year self could pull an all-nighter or chug 5 beers and still function the next day; no longer — so too is our time together finite. 
But this is not the end. In the years that follow, there will be class reunions to attend — and to miss. Baby showers. Weddings. Visits to hospitals (but hopefully not to prison). Funerals. On each of these occasions, I hope we will unpause rather than replay the time we have shared, just as we did. Today.  
“If the past is not to bind us, where can duty lie?” – George Eliot, 1860
When war broke out in the spring of 1861, Uriah Parmelee was a sophomore at Yale. Having grown up on a farm near Guilford, Connecticut, he became an abolitionist in his youth.
Without a second thought, Parmelee dropped out of Yale to join the 6th New York Cavalry. Proclaiming that he was “more of an abolitionist than ever—right up to the handle,” Parmelee fought with bravery and purpose in many of the Civil War’s bloodiest battles. At Chancellorsville he was promoted to the 1st Connecticut Cavalry, and for his actions at the battle of Ashland he gained the rank of captain.
In the sort of tragic irony that colored so much of the nineteenth century, Parmelee was killed eight days before the end of the war. On April 2, 1865 he died at the Battle of Five Forks outside of Petersburg, Virginia. It was the last major battle of the war; eight days later, Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse. To the bitter end, Parmelee had fought for both liberty and the Union. 
What lessons can we learn from men like Parmelee who, as the cenotaph on Beinecke Plaza reads, “gave their lives that freedom might not perish from the earth”? What can Parmelee’s departure from Yale and premature death teach us, students lucky enough to have made it to graduation? At the very least, Parmelee’s legacy should remind us that there is more to a meaningful life than what is found in books and classrooms.
Parmelee wrote many letters to his family from the front, and the story those letters tell should be a familiar one to Yalies, even in 2018. His is a tale of bright-eyed idealism in a world of hatred and bloodshed, of disillusionment with the government’s motives, and of a young Yale student struggling to live by his principles.
Through Parmelee, we can chart the progress of abolitionism in a young mind. At the outset, he believed the Civil War was caused by slavery and would bring about slavery’s destruction. But in 1861, President Lincoln wanted a war of limited aims, and Parmelee grew frustrated at the Union’s reluctance to make eliminating slavery an explicit goal. “I thought that the progress of events must surely bring about universal Emancipation,” he wrote to his mother. He believed that if the army’s principles didn’t change, his conscience would require him to summon “the moral courage to desert it.”
History offers no easy idols, however, and Parmelee is no exception. As he wrote: “Things appear mixed in this world, and motives and actions are not as clearly defined as we might wish them.” Despite his staunch abolitionism, Parmelee had an African-American servant during the war, and seems to have felt no sense of contradiction in this. “I have a little n••••r to wait on me,” he wrote. “How much easier it is to have a little n•g to take your extra steps for you than it is to do all yourself.”
By the summer of 1863, Parmelee’s spirits had been rejuvenated by the Emancipation Proclamation. “I do not intend to shirk now that there is really something to fight for — I mean Freedom,” he wrote. “So then I am willing to remain and endure whatever may fall to my share.”
There is a deep pathos to Parmelee’s story, an impression from reading him that he understood the sacrifice he was making, that he knew the arc of history would bend toward justice only if he placed himself — along with thousands of young men like him — before its altar. 
Students like Parmelee are not so very different from those today; while not all Yalies have been given the chance to enlist in the Union army, when a moment of great national significance passes before us, it is our duty to take part, to endure whatever may fall to our share.
In the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who, two decades later, reflected on the generation of young college students whose lives were caught up in the Civil War, “in our youth our hearts were touched with fire. It was given to us to learn at the outset that life is a profound and passionate thing.” Let us hope that we may someday learn the same, if we haven’t already. 
In our youth, then, we must take up the call of public service and self-sacrifice, taking our places, contradictions and all, in the register of the past. Stop, before you leave campus, in the rotunda of Woolsey Hall. Look at the names, then give Uriah Parmelee’s a rub for good measure.
The closing of our “bright college years” is a time of thank yous. We write letters to professors who have helped us think better. We cook dinner with our closest friends and remember how we laughed and learned and loved, trying to hold onto each other into the future. We lounge in our colleges, thanking the people who have made them feel like home. 
In trying to find the words to thank my parents and my grandmother, I find myself suddenly mute. I am not alone in this quandary, as none of us know how to thank the people who love us so much that our accomplishments feel like their own. They are our parents and grandparents, our siblings and mentors, and they have loved us better than we know.
In part, our “thank yous” must be practical ones. Thank you for our educations. Thank you for feeding us, for flying us home, for talking through our frustrations. Thank you for letting us study what we wanted. Thank you for raising an eyebrow at pictures you wish you hadn’t seen, and thank you for knowing that we would turn out alright. Thank you for trusting us with autonomy, for letting us grow.
This thanks must also extend to the future, as we will continue to rely on the people we love. We have been necessarily independent at Yale as we develop the parts of ourselves that can only grow away from home. But even though we are no longer in school, we still need to be parented, and we still need advice. Some of our questions will be practical. How does one buy a car? How should I quit my first job — and how should I find another? When should I get my first mammogram? Some of our questions will be much harder. How do we navigate differences — religious, financial, emotional — within a marriage? How do we think about how to name our first child? How do we help our guardians age, hurt and mourn as the people they love start aging, too? These future questions are the things we do not even know we will one day need to ask. And so we thank them all the same, knowing that we will always be their children even if we one day have children of our own.
But this ineffable thanks is still rooted in the present. It is the gratitude of a lifetime. For how do we thank the people who have loved and will love us, unequivocally and unconditionally, for the whole of our lives? For the big things — life, sustenance, education — but for the small things, too. For willingly changing their entire lives to bring us into the world, and for continuing to push us further and further out into its embrace. For literacy, for thoughtfulness. For teaching us to keep talking even when a man interrupts. For sitting down to family dinner whenever we could.  For teaching us how to apologize and for also teaching us that love forgives.
I do not know how to say thank you for that which was unquestioningly given, other than to acknowledge that I do not know the immensity of the sacrifice. Is it possible to thank our guardians for spending every day with us as the first thing in their thoughts in the morning, and the last thing in their thoughts at night? How do you thank the people who you love so much that you’ve never questioned that you’ll probably be buried next to them, that you’ll go through the hardest parts of life with them? That when you lose each other, you’ll always have broken off a part of yourself?
There is one obvious way, which is by making something of the love that we have received and to make use of all the ways we have developed. It is to make our lives meaningful and full of love. That is, to have a career that fulfills us, to have friends who we love, to have our own families one day — whatever that may be. Our future happiness is, itself, the thanks.
But, as with all things, my mother has already shown me the right thing to do. Four years ago, as a “going away present,” she gave me a mug. “Call your mother” the mug said — nagged, really — so that every time I made myself tea in the mornings, I’d be reminded to pick up the phone.This is a silly example, but perhaps also the most essential. There is nothing superficial, I’ve recently been told, about the small things, and the best way to thank someone you love is to make them smile in surprise. So call your mom. Call your dad. Call your grandma. Call whomever is that person, the person who parented you, loved you, guided you and challenged you. I don’t know how to say “thank you” better than to do so often and to do so simply. That’s the best way to thank the people we love most in the world for giving us everything that we are.
One of my favorite things about Yale has been watching my friends obsess over their passions: bold start-up ideas, intimidatingly complex research projects, exercise regimens required for military service. When working on these projects, their eyes visibly light up. I consider each of these pursuits a “10 out of 10 opportunity,” the type that truly inspires and can’t be turned down.
As an undergraduate, I pursued my own 10/10 opportunity during my junior year, when I was the editor in chief of this very paper. That meant from 6:30 p.m. until 3 a.m., five nights per week, I was working away at the Yale Daily News building on York Street. 
People often ask me whether such an intense time commitment took away from my college experience. Quite the opposite. I loved editing the News because I believe in this paper and the students who make it.
Other people ask whether it’s my nature to be so busy. Again, the answer is no. I just chose to prioritize an especially exciting opportunity over my personal life for a specific period of time, as many of my classmates did while here.
Editing the News taught me important lessons about leadership, commitment and my own limitations. One of those lessons — the one that feels most relevant to commencement — centers on how I plan to balance my adult life: by prioritizing work when presented with a 10/10 opportunity, and by slowing down when such an opportunity does not exist.  
While at Yale, 10/10 opportunities have looked different for each of us: directing a play, competing for a spot in the starting lineup, leading a campus movement. What ties these experiences together is that, while pursuing them, our passions and hopes took over. For me, that’s what editing the News felt like.
But those moments only come by every so often. And when they don’t — when 10/10 opportunities are nowhere to be found — I have learned while in college how important it is to pump the breaks.
A trap that many Yale students have fallen into, myself included, is the feeling that if we’re not working on something, then we’re doing something wrong. That’s how I felt during my first year here. But my time with the News taught me just how wrongheaded that attitude was.
Once my tenure as EIC came to an end, I instinctively filled my time with a random assortment of tasks. Going from editing the News — a job that meant so much to me — to artificial busyness was at first rather depressing but ultimately clarifying. After a few weeks, I learned to say no to nearly all of the responsibilities that I encountered. Yes, I still pursued the occasional 10/10 opportunity, but by and large I saw my friends, did my readings and slept. I now consider my senior year to be the most personally rewarding of my time at Yale, largely because of the friendships I strengthened over the past nine months.
My point here is two-fold. First, I disagree with people who say that work should never take over your life. If you have a 10/10 opportunity, go all in. Those moments are fleeting and should be taken advantage of. 
But I also disagree with people who let work dominate their lives by default. Work can’t always be so exceptional. That’s why it’s called work. If you lack a 10/10 opportunity, by no means abandon what you’re doing. Just move a bit more slowly.
I am still struggling to get this middle ground just right: diving into 10/10 opportunities, and prioritizing my personal life when such an opportunity does not exist. It’s a hard balance to strike, partially because it is not always clear what, exactly, qualifies as a 10/10 opportunity, at least to me.
As we enter adulthood, none of us should be afraid to pour ourselves into our work at times of particular inspiration. At the same time, none of us should be afraid to focus on ourselves when our work just isn’t all that great. I encourage my fellow graduates to try to live both of these lives: to find fulfillment both professionally and personally. We may not be able to have it all, but that doesn’t mean we can’t try.
To the prefrosh:
As I write this, carefree music is wafting through Cross Campus, overlapping with notes of laughter and undertones of conversation. To my left, a circle of students on wooden chairs bursts into a round of applause, wrapping up a class for the semester. To my right, a wide-eyed student sloughs off his puffer jacket, giving it a new purpose as a makeshift picnic blanket. As spring emerges, so have Yale students — slowing their typically brisk paces, allowing themselves to steep in the warm embrace of a new season. As I gaze upon the scene before me, I watch passersby smile to themselves. Some even make eye contact, as if silently asking me to share in the beauty of this moment with them.
As an opinion columnist, I typically try to offer constructive commentary on the darker parts of our Bright College Years. From alcoholic exclusion to sexual assault to the closing of Commons, I joke with my friends that “every two weeks, I have to figure out what I’m angry about.” However, none of those criticisms are indicative of the general way most people here feel about Yale. As many of you near the May 1st deadline, you may be deciding which school is right for you — the worthiest of the currency that is time, and what makes Yale special.
About eight months ago, I sat on the plush grass behind Ezra Stiles College and wrote what I hoped to get out of my first year here at Yale with my first-year counselor group. After writing our anonymous notes, we scrambled them and passed them around in a circle. The one I ended up with said, “A place that feels like home, a community that offers hope.”
While you will receive an excellent education no matter where you choose to attend, not all colleges will feel like home. Yale is an oddly friendly and happy place, an island of idealism in a troubled world, offering blessed respite for four years. In the mere span of a year, it has become a place where I can walk down the street to a chorus of hellos and beaming smiles, and walk into a dining hall alone, yet emerge with a company of friends.
This isn’t to say that Yale is perfect, or that everyone here wakes up with a smile on their face — far from it. There are days when you’ll feel swamped with assignments, and when the freezing wind will chill you to the bone. But people at Yale buy into a culture of inclusivity and community: We play as a team. When you fall down, we’ll help you back up. We celebrate everyone’s quirks rather than shutting them down — whether it’s a love for public transit, a passion for minority issues or your admiration of calculus.
But what I find most endearing about Yale is the diversity of interactions I’ve found here: ones that have shattered all the stereotypes and cliques I used to see in high school. Before you even arrive on campus, your college dean will sit down with your housing form and handpick a suite for you, one with people who you would probably not befriend otherwise. From them alone, you’ll learn a wealth of lessons. You may find yourself attending fine arts performances to watch their newly choreographed Broadway piece, or taking up a magazine piece on recognition for Native American and indigenous languages, as I did after hearing my suitemate Gabriella’s story about growing up on a reservation in Montana. Their lives will begin to blend with yours, expanding your horizons in broad strokes and helping you see this campus from angles you never could have imagined.
One-fourth of my time on this campus is up, a fact that becomes more real to me as I write notes and well-wishes to graduating seniors, many of whom have loved me beyond compare. But as they leave, we will welcome you with open arms, much like the ones that helped us move in our suitcases on the first day and embraced us during times of hardship. I told you earlier that Yale is an oddly friendly place, a fact buffered by how much we love our first-year students.
As the seasons begin to change once again, campus will too. Soon, spring will fade into summer, and you will begin to pack up all you have ever known. Rest assured, regardless of how daunting Yale may seem, that you are in for the best years of your life — these “Bright College Years.” From all of us, welcome home.
Best,
Kat
The student income contribution isn’t a lot of money. If you deduct “estimated personal expenses” from your financial aid award letter, the number will come out to $630 for first years and students with no expected parental contribution, who are usually the focus of discourse. Campus minimum wage is $12.75 and it isn’t particularly hard to find a job that pays more. Even at the lowest wage, it comes out to about 50 hours a year, or less than an hour a week. The rest of one’s hours of employment can go to personal expenses, not greedy daddy Yale.
I am a low income student, a First-Year Scholars at Yale alumnus, with a blue-collar father, a huge scholarship and an underperforming high school. I am also a busy student. This semester, I am taking five reading-heavy seminars. All take attendance and expect plenty of participation, so I can’t feasibly skip or arrive unprepared. When I’m not in class, I have a leadership role with the Yale Debate Association and go to tournaments. I’m also a varsity athlete.
And I have a campus job. Actually, I have two. I usually work between seven and ten hours a week at the Yale College Dean’s Office or as a sports reporter. I make good money, and only a small portion of it goes to Yale.
What might surprise some readers is that I do not feel oppressed or pressured by this situation. While everyone struggles with procrastination, and I am no exception, I have never felt that I could not get my work done.
I recognize that this sounds like I am bragging. I am not. I have had struggles too, and they are more demoralizing than working a campus job. I was not prepared for Yale. For me, it was a tremendous struggle overcoming my background. In my first year on campus, my roommate called me ignorant for saying “taller than me” instead of “taller than I.” In my math class, I sat silently and then wrangled the problem sets on my own because I didn’t know that it was all right to see the peer tutor. In high school, I was the peer tutor. I had no idea what I was supposed to do for the summer, so I ended up hanging posters and distributing keys. If I had come from another family, perhaps my experience would have been different. If I had had a mentor to guide me, perhaps I would have done better.
Cash wouldn’t have helped me. I bought my textbooks for nearly nothing on the “Free and For Sale” Facebook group and from the YHHAP Book Sale. I worked a little to pay for my expenses and that small sum Yale expected. I’m moving off campus next year, which should save me a significant amount of money.
Yale has numerous centers for marginalized groups on campus: La Casa Cultural, the Women’s Center and the LGBTQ Co-op, to name a few. There is no center for low-income or first generation students, and I think that is really a shame. The Dean’s Office has recently launched a program called the First Generation and Low Income Ambassadors. I am one of them. We direct students to services such as the winter clothing fund and produce a newsletter for students who share our backgrounds. While this is a step forward, we have no physical location, no peer liasons and limited funding.
Eliminating the student income contribution would cost a massive amount of money. While a few hundred dollars go directly to Yale, another $3,000 or so is estimated for personal expenses and travel, which is, at least in my case, a massive overestimation. Those who oppose the contribution usually want both eliminated. Given that approximately half of undergrads are on financial aid, that comes out to millions of dollars a year. For me, I would rather have a center created to advocate for our needs and provide targeted services to students of my background. With more money, I might buy my textbooks new instead of used and potentially go out to dinner. My life wouldn’t change that much. A center could help students from my background navigate Yale and form a more coherent community in order to ultimately achieve more success.
While the student income contribution is a focus of campus discourse, I believe that the money required to eliminate it could be better spent establishing such a center. The number of hours we are expected to work are absurdly low for the amount of controversy, and a center would better serve the needs of students like me.

It is fitting to begin my final column for the News in the same way I have begun so many before: with an aphorism from my grandmother. The best thing about someone, she’ll often say, is the flip side of the worst thing said about them. If they’re absentminded, perhaps they’re delightfully dreamy. If they’re unwilling to argue, perhaps they’re a rock for their friends. If they’re critical, perhaps they’re also incisively perceptive. The most beautiful part of someone’s character is also the ugliest. That Janus-faced personality schism is what makes us ourselves.
At Yale, we condemn each other as “performative.” It’s one of our most common campus insults. I perform. She performs. That’s performative. Calling someone “performative” is akin to calling them “inauthentic,” claiming that they have no internal motivation. In a time when we are supposed to be investigating and developing ourselves, “performative” is a crime of disingenuousness.
Following my grandmother’s theory, “performative” must be the flip side of the strongest part of Yale. I think — I hope — that the beauty behind “performative” is a beauty in Yale’s collective. You cannot be performative if you do not have an audience who cares enough to spectate. And what is that, then, other than a “community”?
Our communal performance is also a communal audienceship, one that fosters some of the best and the most ubiquitous parts of Yale. To build community, we listen to each other’s life stories in pre-orientation programs, clubs and senior societies. We watch Cross Campus balloon and empty, balloon and empty again. We pay attention to our friends’ motivations and engage with their explorations. We do not carve out space to live in isolation here. Instead, we etch ourselves onto each other, an imprinting that creates an interested audience — and, thus, a community.
Only now, staring down the chute at graduation, am I beginning to understand how Yale’s community has changed my worldview. Over break, I found old journals and was surprised by how different my goals are now from when I started college. My goals were classes and career, an academic and intellectual approach to the future befitting an 18-year-old nerd. Of course, I absolutely wanted friendships from college but was more excited to feel as though my mind would be pulled apart in seminars. I thought of college as primarily a place for thinking, expecting friendships to come afterward.
In graduating now, these goals are almost unrecognizable. Of course, I aim to be excited and effective in my career. But career goals are now just some among many. Now, I know I will also work to have a strong and sturdy group of friends, people I call often to check in and check up. I want something resembling a weekly meal, a ritual over food to develop a community over time. I want to love someone well and to one day love our children well, too. My career aspirations now stand next to my desire for a concrete and visible community.
This, to me, is the most obvious effect of Yale on my life, and I think I am in good company with the class of 2018. Yale is both womblike and claustrophobic, a community both nurturing and exhausting. Losing an established community is the most obvious rupture between the past and the future that starts in just a few weeks, when we launch our caps into the air. Here, we have roommates who are familiar with our pattern of time. Here, we have adults who care about us unraveling and retying our thoughts together, adults who help us make better versions of ourselves. Here, we have a shared reality in a way we won’t ever again. But we will carry the memory of what a community feels like into our future. We will know that we can one day make that again.
The task of these next few months — these next few years, really — will be to decompress from our Yale performance before we build and rebuild a new community. Living without a caring audience will be a useful readjustment and a useful return to lives that exist out of view from Yale. Once we’ve ironed out the worst of our performative selves and have learned how to live without an audience, we’ll be ready to come back to a community again.
We didn’t become our first draft of our adult selves in isolation and we will not be able to edit those selves alone either. To re-become is not something we can do hermetically, and we’ll be lucky to know what it’s like to be in a place where we see and we are seen. This will be the hardest part of our 20s, I think: to learn a new way to be part of something again. Luckily, we’ve got a pretty good model to emulate.
Yesterday, while I was sitting on a Bulldog Days panel about student life at Yale, a prefrosh asked a question that struck me deeply. “With regard to majors, everyone’s talked a lot about finding what you’re interested in … I’m wondering what it means to be interested in something — and how you know when you’ve found it.” All of the panelists were silent.
Whether it’s because I can’t articulate an answer, or because I don’t have one, I have been mulling over this question ever since that panel. Because, implicit in the question of what it means to be interested in something, is the question of how best to make our time here meaningful — a struggle with which I think everyone at Yale can identify in some capacity.
Coming to Yale, I had a hyper-rigid idea of what I should be getting out of my time here: “I’m here for academics,” I’d tell my parents. “I can make any campus life work, so long as I’m plugged into books and discussion.”
Yale is ultimately concerned with providing such a diverse array of programs, classes, research opportunities and majors, that no intellectual pursuit is out of reach. This is one of Yale’s biggest strengths, but, with my first year at Yale coming to a close, I think there are legitimate shortcomings to this overabundance of intellectual offerings.
For example, it is easy for those who don’t know exactly what they wish to do to find shopping period as a sprint to every remotely interesting listed class in an attempt to fully immerse themselves in the incredible course offerings. For these people, making final cuts to their classes on Coursetable is more like soul pruning. Indeed, there is an anxiety of missing out that spurs a culture of hyperactivity — where we zip along, trying to never miss out, while, in the process, missing out all the more.
Socially, too, Friday and Saturday nights are packed with suite parties and pregames, sometimes a club mixer, then fraternity parties or the occasional birthday party. Time spent at one is time lost at another, and as trivial as it may seem, it was typical for my friends to try and attend as many hosted events as possible, and still feel dissatisfied — like they had not fully seized the night even in their midnight maudlin frenzy.
All too often friendships fall victim to this same anxiety of missing out. I met up with a close friend of mine the other day, and she was telling me about how she has her plate full just maintaining the close friendships she has now. As I left she added, with a painful half-smile, how that night she had three dinners with three different people scheduled back to back to back.
So many of us buy into the friendship-over-dinner mentality because of its convenience. My hesitation is that friendship can too easily become so bureaucratized and G-Cal-ed that the only thing holding it together is an occasional meal. And while this may mean that we have time to meet more people or get our work done, we are sacrificing deeper, more fulfilling personal connections.
I don’t think the proper conclusions to draw from this are that Yale should whittle away its course offerings, or that we should have fewer party options, or even that we should necessarily spend more time with our friends. Instead, I simply wish to take these reflections and have them inform us as how to best make our time count. Practically, I think that means slowing down and not falling prey to the anxiety of missing out.
One of the rituals of Yale is self-transformation. In that vein, I have increasingly found that my naïve ideas of academic rigor being my lifeblood at college were just that — half-baked and poorly founded. The fact of the matter is that if Yale were only concerned with offering intense intellectualism, we would all do better to save a quarter of a million dollars and read books and Wikipedia articles.
President Peter Salovey began this academic year by urging us to “emulate the fox.” But, in reflecting on my first year, and on how to best answer that prefrosh’s question, I’ve found that fulfillment comes more from the depth of our engagements — with friendships or with academics — than in the breadth of our engagement for breadth’s sake.
Two weeks ago, I announced a campaign for Yale College Council President. I lost to Saloni Rao, an individual who I am confident will do great things for our university. I entered the race to improve the dialogue in these YCC campaigns, and I stand behind what we accomplished. But, this piece is about something entirely different.
There is something overtly wrong at our school, but so commonplace that we no longer bat an eye at it. It’s about what we say in dining halls, in coffee shops, in the gym to the person on the next treadmill. Russians call it propaganda. Trump calls it fake news. In years to come, textbooks might call it sensationalism. Here at Yale, we call it activism.
This school has become a breeding ground for false narratives, pushed forth to justify whatever activist agenda we choose to pursue. How do these narratives get spread? That’s the worst part. We ourselves play the part of the Russians in a manner that is scaringly similar to the retweeting, unthinking bots of the 2016 election. These false and misleading narratives, however, only serve to cripple the advocacy they try to promote.
Let’s look at the some examples from the past week:
Last week, members of Students Unite Now launched a sit-in in at the Office of Financial Aid, demanding the elimination of the student income contribution. I am opposed to the student income contribution, and I ran during my YCC campaign on establishing a 501(c)(3) to fund its reduction — a promise I do intend to still keep. But this organization all too often misleads to the detriment of what they are advocating for. For instance, their website points to frequent budget surpluses and endowment gains of the University and purports that, “Yale has continued to impose higher and higher financial demands on students who receive financial aid by increasing the contribution it expects these students to pay.” To state that the University has increased the student income contribution in recent years is factually inaccurate. To suggest that individual budget surpluses would enable the elimination of the contribution ignores how the University’s budgeting actually works. Misleading on the issue plays right into the administration’s hands.
This week, the News published a piece that focused partially on Yale administrator Dean Burgwell Howard. Engender, an organization dedicated to improving social spaces, immediately issued a Facebook post: “Did you know that Yale’s administrator responsible for overseeing Greek organizations was in a fraternity suspended at Dartmouth for referring to women as ‘sperm receptacles’?” The incident they were referring to occurred nearly two years after the administrator graduated from the school. To defame his reputation based on tangential associations is nothing more than a red herring. At the beginning of this school year, the same organization passed out a flyer stating, “[Leo] Fraternity members discriminated against students of color at the door of their party, publicly declaring that ‘white girls only’ were allowed entrance.” With respect to the incident they reference, however, the Yale Dean’s office found no evidence of ‘systematic discrimination against people of color.’ To pass off conjecture as fact is dangerous and a disservice to the very real issues Engender is advocating for.
During the Yale College Council debate, Saloni Rao and I responded ‘no’ to a rapid-fire question of whether institutional racism at Yale exists. The ‘activists’ pounced, turning to ‘Overhead at Yale’ to highlight our answer to the question. In response, I published my personal phone number on the thread and texts immediately poured in. One I received suggested that my entire campaign was “reminiscent of the white savior complex.” Another person suggested I was like Donald Trump — it seems for no other reason than my answer during the debate and the fact that my campaign slogan had the same number of syllables as “drain the swamp.” And another directly implied I was racist. It was not uncommon to hear in dining halls the following days that we believed racism did not exist or had no respect for the cultural houses at this school. To suggest either is obviously false. To imply racism is absurd. And to do so only distracts from important conversations on an issue that is too often overlooked.
We are quick to deride the Trumpian era of fake news and sensationalism. But, we fail to see it at our own school. When untruths and conjectures get passed off as facts, we fall into dangerous territory. To Engender, Students Unite Now and other activist organizations at this school: To distract with false narratives spoils any chance of change. You can do better. In 2016, Russians destabilized our democracy by pushing forth untrue narratives. In spreading conjecture and passing false narratives off as truths, we’re not much better.

I often feel apologetic when I tell people that I am an opinion columnist for the News. The opinion pages, so the narrative goes, are where first years repeat trite nothings and out-of-touch conservatives pontificate. I am a little sheepish when I reveal my commitment to this page because it can be a forum for ideas that are repeated or condescending, representative of a larger campus discourse that upholds platitudes about what a good life is or pushes back against a paper-doll caricature of leftism. Despite all this, the opinion page is also the most read.
Over the past few months, a national conversation has been playing out over what a newspaper opinion section ought to be, and what sorts of editorial pieces publications should print, and, therefore, amplify. The beginning of that conversation can perhaps be attributed to the hiring of James Bennet at The New York Times. Bennet, the editorial page editor, quickly began to bring writers on board who were different from the paper’s typical center-left tone and readership. His first hire, Bret Stephens, provoked outrage from readers when he urged readers to be more skeptical of climate change activists in his first column.
The furor over Stephens was quickly followed by repeated uproars over the writing and tweets of his fellow former Wall Street Journal opinion page writer Bari Weiss. Weiss positions herself as a liberal fed up with the excesses of the far left, particularly on college campuses — conveniently ignoring that she herself attempted to silence professors for being insufficiently pro-Israel while she was a student at Columbia University.
Leah Finnegan, writing in the online magazine the Outline, characterizes this genre of opinion writing, as “trolling,” a phrase more familiar in the context of misspelled tweets and unmoderated comment section than about the paper of record. “They’re not seeking to upend established, calcified viewpoints,” says Finnegan, “but deliberately instigating anger and spreading disinformation in an insincere attempt to ‘show both sides.’” Weiss in particular has savored being attacked on Twitter, portraying herself as a martyr whose good intentions are being deliberately twisted. A refusal to listen to those you’ve hurt with your prominent platform, though, does not demonstrate good intentions.
I grew up in a home where the Wall Street Journal greeted me on the breakfast table every day. Even as a high schooler I had politics that were different than those of my parents, but I did occasionally flip through to the opinion section. It was rare that I agreed with anything I read. What struck me, though, was that every writer seemed to know whom they were speaking to. They were not writing to agitate readers they assumed would disagree with them, but rather putting forth arguments for the community of conservatives to consider.
What makes Bret Stephens’ questioning of climate change assumptions “trolling” is not the argument, per se, but rather its context; for James Bennet to publish it for the Times’ readership when Stephens was a new hire failed to take seriously that for any columnist to have the power to persuade, they need to be trusted. Stephens in that context was completely untrustworthy, and there was no reason to assume that he wrote in good faith rather than to poke at the liberals he had been criticizing for so long. So too, Weiss’s insistence that she is a put-upon liberal while failing to listen to those whose politics she claims to share is “trolling” because her refusal to hear her critics makes it hard to believe that she is someone just trying to better the world.
To push from outside some sort of cohesive community, or to act as if one is above the community they write for degrades a writer’s impact. This is not an effective way to be heard and to build a vibrant conversation about how we should live our lives and shape our world. Good opinion columnists see themselves as pushing a community that they trust to hear them, one that they are a part of. This can be a political community, an ideological one, even one of circumstance. Trust and good faith are key: Writing to challenge is not the same as writing to antagonize.
We have a unique opportunity at Yale: We know exactly who we are addressing when we write in campus publications. What would it look like if we wrote in a way that assumed each person on our campus is smart and well intentioned? What would it look like to push each other with the goal of creating a stronger community, rather than pushing each other over in order to score intellectual points?
A few weeks ago, I invited a few close friends to my suite for an evening of cheese tasting — the perfect night in. Since one of my friends lives in my entryway in Benjamin Franklin College, our friend from Pierson made the trek north, through the snow. Upon arrival, he found himself lost in one of our smaller courtyards: He had visited the dining hall but had never been to Benjamin Franklin to socialize.
“I always make my friends come closer to campus!” he explained.
My friend’s unfamiliarity with Benjamin Franklin’s layout is indicative of a broader problem facing Yale’s two new residential colleges and their students: Though hundreds of students live north of the Grove Street Cemetery, the vast majority of social events take place in the center of campus, a substantial walk away.
My experiences living in Benjamin Franklin have, for the most part, been wonderful. Our head of college and dean have worked tirelessly to build a tightly knit community on Prospect Street, despite our noticeable dearth of older students and established traditions. Events such as our weekly happy hour and annual Halloween trick-or-treating are sure to become perennial traditions for generations of Yale students. I hear similar sentiments from our neighbors in Pauli Murray. Something, however, feels missing.
Though the Benjamin Franklin dining hall is filled to the brim at lunch each weekday with students from Science Hill who crave our bibimbap and pizza, entire tables remain empty at dinner. The recent “Declaration of IndepenDance” failed to attract more than a handful of students while Jonathan Edwards’ Spider Ball, held on the same night, was packed. Intercollege social life remains firmly entrenched within a hundred-yard radius of Cross Campus.
The residential colleges were not designed to exist on their own. Living in a heterogeneous community is a wonderful way to meet people with different interests, but this should not come at the expense of being able to socialize with peers in different colleges. When two colleges are far removed from the others, the distance becomes a geographic barrier to attending social events for those students — especially during the cold season that lasts for half of the academic year. While my classmates living on Old Campus or in the central colleges can easily catch up with friends on weeknights, I know that the frigid round trip will cost me 20 or 30 minutes in commuting time — time most of us do not have to spare.
Nothing can be done about the physical distance between the new colleges and the rest of campus, but strategic policy can mitigate the difficulty of staying socially connected with friends in other colleges. Administrators should implement a more frequent and convenient shuttle service linking Benjamin Franklin and Pauli Murray with central campus during dinner hours and on Friday and Saturday nights, making it easier for classmates to join us for meals and social events.
The new colleges also need to offer more incentives for students to visit — clearly, even the enhanced dining halls are not enough. Benjamin Franklin and Pauli Murray can plan — and widely advertise — more weekend events that will attract members of other colleges, such as dances and study breaks. Administrators can also incentivize groups and clubs, who host a large proportion of campus social activities, to hold events in the new colleges by subsidizing the cost of snacks and beverages and making it easier to book common spaces.
One of the most inconvenient aspects of living in Benjamin Franklin is the distance from commercial areas. Students in all other colleges, including Silliman and Timothy Dwight, live a stone’s throw from coffee shops and other businesses that serve as social spaces. The area around the new colleges, in contrast, consists entirely of offices and academic buildings. A handy solution would be to open a cafe like The Acorn in Silliman, enticing students from all colleges to spend time on Prospect Street.
Integrating two new colleges into the fabric of Yale’s social scene is no small feat, and I do not wish to sound ungrateful for my new home. A lot of work has already been put into the creation of close-knit community with lasting traditions. I fear, however, that in their quest to build photogenic buildings, the Yale administration has neglected to adequately consider the social needs of the students who live in those spaces.
Social isolation is pernicious, and its effects are far reaching. The Yale administration should do more to ensure all students can live fulfilling social lives on campus.
Dear First Year:
When you first arrived on campus, we told you an inviting story: The admissions office makes no mistakes. Yale is a community. You belong. In my last regular column for the News, it is my sad duty to disabuse you of these silly ideas.
First, you don’t deserve to be here. And yes, the admissions office makes mistakes — but only if you let them. The job of the admissions office is not to distribute the spoils of war after the arms race that is high school, but to make a gamble — a gamble on who will do the most good for our world. So, don’t worry about whether you are smart enough or prepared enough or good-looking enough for Yale. All of us lucked out in some way in the lottery of life. They call it the imposter syndrome as though it’s a bad thing, but we are all imposters now.
So don’t take yourself too seriously, but take what you do seriously. Whether it is rowing on the crew team or organizing in New Haven or doing research in a lab, you have a chance to make good on someone else’s bet. The path ahead will be hard, but how else would you have it? You didn’t come here to sleepwalk from First-Year Assembly in Woolsey Hall to Commencement on Old Campus.
For Yale may be a community, but you are also an individual, with a cascade of choices that you — and only you — can make. Before college, life was fairly linear, like a Jane Austen novel. The early 20s, however, feel more like a “Choose Your Own Adventure” story. Some of the choices will be personal: How much does money mean to you? What about family or power? Other decisions will be ethical. What obligations do we owe one another? Will you lie or betray someone to get ahead? What does friendship mean to you?
There are no definite answers, but the last thing you want is for others to make those choices on your behalf. In the end, life is not Credit/D/Fail. All lives may be equal, but not all lives are equally well-lived, and the best place to experiment with these choices is at Yale.
Speaking of choices, you should be a history major — though not necessarily of the thesis-picture-outside-Sterling variety. By “majoring” in history, I mean thinking — and living — in time. Seeing yourself as a historical subject will help you recognize that your experience — and our moment — is unique but not exceptional. That our pasts — individual and collective — animate the present but don’t predetermine the future. That our personal and shared destinies are entangled. That the choices we make matter.
And remember: You don’t belong at Yale. With or without you, this 316-year-old institution will get on just fine. To seek to belong is to buy into Yale’s conceit, to accept that the University is nothing more than dusty portraits and fancy parties, Gothic archways and landed tombs. These are the things that give Yale its cultural authority, but these are not the things that make Yale. To desire them is to transform history into kitsch; to hold them in contempt is to reject a shared inheritance, but nonetheless to affirm their power. The trick, then, is not to try to belong, but to create a Yale that belongs to you.
One of the greatest joys of college has been to build a home away from home, from the spaces I have inhabited — my favorite spot in the Saybrook College dining hall — to the rituals I have developed — I plead the fifth — to the friends I have made, and some others. The greatest joy has been to share this world with those around me, with all its imperfections and idiosyncrasies. I am sad to leave this life behind, but that sadness only belies the joy and gratitude I feel to have made this place my own. When it’s your turn to leave, I hope you, too, will feel the same.
Sincerely,
The Analyst (formerly The Wallflower)
Seeing as this is my last column for the News, I had been planning to write something anodyne and unprovocative, a meditation on speaking one’s mind, perhaps, or a tribute to all the people and professors who make Yale great in spite of itself.
But I’m not going to do that.
Instead, I want to end by thinking about the promise of an elite education and why it is denied to so many — about the boasts and bromides and banalities that allow so-called egalitarians to mask their privilege within an academy that exists chiefly for their benefit.
Don’t worry: This won’t be another shut-up-and-be-grateful tirade against financial aid activists or virtue-signaling progressives. I actually agree with much of what’s been said in opposition to the student income contribution, which the preponderance of evidence suggests is balkanizing Yale along class lines. The problem is not that these activists portray the contribution as unfair — it is — but rather that their jeremiads are part of a self-defeating ideological program that sustains the very evils it decries.
That program, advanced by Students Unite Now, most cultural houses and the occasional News editorial, basically proposes we fix corporate greed through a vast, viscous bureaucracy made up entirely of corporate middlemen. In keeping with today’s intersectional credo, calls for financial aid reform are almost always paired with calls for more graduate unionization, more sensitivity training, more diversity initiatives — in other words, more administrators and more money.
This was true in 2015, when Students Unite Now threw its support behind Next Yale’s demands; it was true the following year, when they launched a photo campaign explicitly linking the student income contribution with countless other injustices.
And it remains true now, in the day-to-day thick of campus life, as America’s young aristocrats demand every imaginable comfort and indulgence from an obliging administrative class. Those demands lead quite naturally to increasing corporatization, which in turn leads to higher tuition prices and fewer subsidies for low- and middle-income students. A consistent reform program would focus on cutting bureaucratic sinecures and reducing expenditures — to use a Trumpian metaphor, on draining the swamp. Instead, reformers have bloated the swamp with all manner of vestigial cronies and curiosities, most of which do very little except create problems, often expensive problems, for other apparatchiki to solve.
The result is a system whose chief beneficiaries are the very rich and very poor. Park and 5th sybarites get to experience four years of hedonism under the watchful eye of student life professionals, while the underprivileged receive a passport to the middle class in exchange for diversifying Yale’s demographic profile. The losers are everyone in between: middle- and lower-middle-class students too rich to be offered a full ride and too poor to foot the bill on their own. Numerous loopholes mean the so-called “sliding scale” slides very quickly once your family income hits $50,000, and although Yale “does not expect students to take out loans,” those expectations are frequently confounded by unforeseen economic realities.
The debate over the student income contribution is therefore something of a red herring insofar as the policy does not actually keep anybody out of Yale. By contrast, lackluster aid for the middle class discourages many students from applying in the first place, leaving behind a rather unrepresentative sample of the indigent and well-to-do. This may be one reason elite colleges have such difficulty cultivating intellectual variance: Their financial aid regimes subsidize the main voting blocs of the Democratic Party to the exclusion of ordinary Americans.
Of course, some middle-class folks do beat the odds and make the most of their time here. But in my experience such students — especially white ones — are the most resentful of institutions notionally dedicated to improving financial aid. The Black Students Alliance, the Yale Women’s Center and the LGBT co-op have all endorsed efforts to eliminate the student income contribution, citing its disproportionate impact on minorities. Yet these same groups have also demanded ever more deans and deanlets and administrators to advance their multiculturalist vision — mediated mostly by the cultural centers — all of whom cost money that could have gone towards financial aid instead. It doesn’t help that the most vocal activists tend to be fairly privileged themselves and enjoy a certain degree of social capital as a result: Nobody likes to be lectured about their role in oppressive power structures, especially when the people doing the lecturing have all the power.
The class dynamics of Yale thus parallel the class dynamics of the nation. Identity politics and a sprawling kludgeocracy have made meaningful reforms almost impossible, and because of that, the tensions which fuel identity politics and kludgeocracy have steadily worsened. Marxian analyses have their limits, to be sure; it’s quite possible I’ve overemphasized the role economics play in what is at heart an ideological struggle between two rival visions of the University, each with its own share of partisans.
But as every political theorist knows, ideas do not exist in a vacuum. Class, that vexing and incurable specter, will always shape our politics when we least expect it to.
Especially if, as is often the case, our Jeremiahs work for Goldman.

Research conducted by institutions ranging from the American Psychological Association to Harvard Medical School validate the pet effect, the array of health benefits springing from the human–animal bond. In particular, pet ownership is linked to improvements in various aspects of mental health, including a reduction in depression, anxiety, stress and panic attacks. The increasing student demand for mental health services underscores the rising prevalence of mental health issues at Yale and the administration’s responsibility to adapt to changing student needs.
Our student population already recognizes the restorative power of animals, as evidenced by therapy dogs at various events like study breaks and Mind Matters’ Fresh Check Day, which have consistently high turnouts. Allowing pets in selected housing spaces will not only provide student pet owners regular access to the coping mechanisms they desire but also add a much-needed element of organization to typically unstructured and chaotic college schedules. Many students find that following a routine lends stability to their lives. Walking and feeding pets at regular intervals promotes good time management and healthy sleeping habits which are critical to mental peace.
Perhaps the most valuable service pets can provide students is companionship. College students across our social media–obsessed world report increased feelings of loneliness and isolation, which are highly prevalent although much underdiscussed at Yale. A 2016 study at the University of British Columbia found that, after participating in an 8-week animal-assisted therapy program, first-year university students reported reduced homesickness and greater life satisfaction. Most Yalies hail from outside Connecticut, and bringing pets can alleviate the separation anxiety and homesickness that accompanies leaving home for the first time. Students can find solace in the warm greeting of their pet upon returning to their dorms, and taking the pet outside will make isolating themselves indoors impossible. The presence of a pet — a great conversation starter — can also facilitate socializing and benefit more introverted students.
Many colleges have already begun catering to students’ mental health demands by allowing pets other than fish on campus. Caltech and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are famous for allowing cats in various dorms, and students can live with their dogs and cats in Washington & Jefferson College’s “Pet House.” Selected housing spaces at Eckerd College, University of Washington, University of Illinois and University of North Carolina have been designated as pet friendly.
Although Yale’s grassy residential college courtyards and wide Old Campus lawn seem perfect for frolicking pets, the University has a strict no-pet policy, with the exception of service and assistance animals for those with a medically documented disability.
The University can pilot a revised pet policy by designating one entryway in Silliman, Timothy Dwight, Pauli Murray or Benjamin Franklin colleges “pet friendly.” First-years or upper levels who opt to bring a pet on the housing preferences form will be placed into this entryway accordingly. Restrictions include limiting the number of pets per floor, requiring written agreement of all suitemates to house the pet, disallowing pets in bathrooms and prohibiting washing of pet products in washing machines. The University of North Carolina’s pet friendly housing space has a separate laundry machine for this purpose. Additionally, all pets must be under a certain size, quiet and house-trained, and the University will maintain the right to contact students if the pet’s behavior becomes disruptive or dangerous.
Students who are going to be away for extended hours can leave their pet in an on-campus pet day care, similar to the one that exists at Stephens College. It should not be hard to attract student volunteers to provide animal care from our pet-loving population, and all Yalies will be welcome to visit and interact with the animals for an instant mood lift.
Through initiatives like offering free mindfulness meditation classes and expanding mental health counseling services, Yale has shown an increasing commitment to addressing students’ mental health issues. But the college student mental health crisis we currently face calls for investment of time and resources into big changes. Maybe a pet-friendly campus could be one of them.   
When I first got to Yale, my immediate concern was finding another “Game of Thrones” nerd at the finale showing. Feeling at home was the mission. And it was like that for the first few days, Camp Yale, when the major task was finding where to go out each night.
But that only lasted until Aug. 30. Classes began and the frenzy of shopping period consumed students, who were anxiously trying to get into this class or find the strength not to choose that one. An adviser gave me a quick piece of advice: Get your shopping over quickly; otherwise, you’ll be two weeks behind.
But I didn’t know who I was. And I’m still trying to figure that out. So, with 2,000 classes to choose from, leading me down 100 paths, how did this professor expect me to make my decision quickly? Wasn’t my first year supposed to be when I didn’t need to be sure of what I wanted and could just let my path find me? Why was I supposed to know what I want within the first week — where was my time to find myself?
Except he was right. Because, while I was juggling the uncertainty accumulated from weighing so many classes, new opportunities — which I couldn’t fully devote my attention to — presented themselves: student organizations.
Like so many here at Yale, I found myself inundated with flashy opportunities that I had absolutely no clue about. What was substantive and what was resume fodder? The extracurricular bazaar just provided endless panlists. In the face of all these unknowns, I did what any sane person would do; I signed up for everything that sounded remotely interesting, because how else was I to find what I liked? Whatever asked the most of me, I stuck with.
What I was left with was a shallow sense of productivity, perennially feeling like I had too much to do yet always feeling like I wasn’t doing enough. A few of my interests were nurtured by sheer luck, but in many ways, I felt deeply unsatisfied. All organizations found the people they wanted, and I really was behind. The door was shut — exploration a fantasy.
But that’s total bull! Despite some “exclusive” competition or performance-based organizations closing their doors, there still remained a plethora of organizations that were willing to welcome me with open arms. I just didn’t know which and where. Most organizations had already given up on exerting effort to finding new members in September, leaving me with little room to try anything new without exercising completely independent initiative.
And, so, until second semester when I figured all this out, I felt trapped.
I know I was not alone in these sentiments. At the extracurricular bazaar in the fall, there were still many sophomores searching for new opportunities. And many a conversation with my first-year friends had devolved into how to handle large workloads and the uncertainty of not knowing what we want. For many, it’s not that we couldn’t handle the work; it’s that the work we did didn’t lead us to our purpose.
It doesn’t have to be like this, though. Student organizations could commit to revamping recruitment efforts at the midpoint of each semester. This way new students on campus do not feel locked in after their third week. Organizations could find more members who run for board positions because it would strengthen their passions, not their CVs. People would have more time to actually learn what organizations like the Yale College Council did so that they weren’t scrambling to find out when election season hit. By giving people time to familiarize themselves with organizations, happier and more dedicated members will join. And by giving people flexibility to join and quit organizations more freely, campus culture would feel more fulfilling.
I know this might create a headache in clubs that require intensive manpower to initiate new recruits. And, for others, it’s just not feasible due to competition dates. But for the majority, the rewards outweigh the concerns because it would allow us to live up to the liberal arts spirit of embracing the search for ourselves.
To any prefrosh, Yale is a vibrant, vivacious place saturated with motivated and ambitious people who get to work from day one. And if it’s our campus you choose, your first weeks will be intimidating, nerve-wracking, exciting and hopefully straight up fun. But wherever you go, take the time beforehand to create an action plan of what you want to do first semester and whom you want to seek. It’s only in September and January that the opportunities will seek you out. Then it will be up to you to root them out.
And, maybe next year, here at Yale, we can give first years a little more time to find themselves.
In her TED Talk on the “single story,” Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie addresses our adherence to single stories — of places and their political landscapes, of others, and of ourselves. We advance the single story because it allows us to understand the world in a linear, comfortable way and to comprehend ideas of excellence one-dimensionally.
From the days of Camp Yale, we’re inundated with opportunities and thus a plethora of choices. Almost every day, we confront these choices, ranging from academic to personal to extracurricular. Perhaps as a consequence, we ache to be chosen.
All of us, by virtue of being at Yale, have already been chosen in some respect, and we will carry this stamp of exclusivity with us as we move through this world. But we want to be chosen again, by our professors, by our peers, by coveted programs.
We want to belong to the cohort of students. We want to belong to the society, to be tapped on the shoulder, to be told that we are wanted, that we are good enough.
We subconsciously prize meaningless competitions that validate our desire to be chosen, that convince us so well that exclusivity is synonymous with excellence. Often, we forget that while these communities can be valuable, we don’t need the program to take the classes we want to take or to pursue the opportunities we are passionate about, and that we don’t need the society to form genuine bonds with one another.
The other day in class, my professor spontaneously began to tell us about her journey to becoming tenured at Yale. She said that, had she herself applied to Yale years ago, she wouldn’t have gotten in. She spoke of the language that surrounds tenured professors here, of being “the chosen ones” who will impact academia. She told us that she regards these words with the most skeptical eye, and she asked, “Who is doing the choosing, and what are the inherent power structures involved? Moreover, why is it that once someone else has deemed something or someone worthy, only then can we find value in it?”
For every person who is tapped for a group or a society, who is chosen to belong to a selective program, there is someone who wasn’t chosen. For any accomplishment of mine, there is a morning when I almost couldn’t get out of my bed. For every person who got into Yale, there’s someone who the system weaned out. As my professor was speaking, I began to cry. I didn’t notice until I felt the residue of tears on my cheeks.
I thought about friends of mine who had gone through the tap and rush processes and who felt inadequate because they weren’t chosen. I thought of my peers at other universities who are as — or more — talented and curious and passionate as me, who wouldn’t get to sit in this lecture hall or have the privilege of saying they felt bored or jaded with Yale. I thought about my friend who wondered if she shouldn’t pursue education because she wasn’t selected for the Education Studies Program or my other friend who told me that her successes had begun to feel wholly meaningless. I felt immensely saddened by the sheer number of arbitrary competitions we constantly subject ourselves to. In most cases I’ve seen, exclusivity does not lead to greater happiness or the nebulous idea of success that we chase.
Recently, I read Junot Diaz’s piece in the New Yorker about his childhood trauma and its repercussions. He had kept this story inside for so long, and I began to wonder about the stories that each of us suppresses in favor of a more visible one. We can never know what anyone else harbors inside. This is what I do know: For every story we choose to tell, there is an alternate story we could have told. I hope we choose to pay attention to the lesser-told ones, when we can. I hope we tell the stories of the times we weren’t tapped on the shoulder, or when we felt most vulnerable. I hope we share with each other how we struggle, and not just how we appear to succeed. I hope we rewrite the narrative that exclusivity means excellence at Yale. We belong, even if we can’t point to or name the club or the program or the society we belong to.
Last weekend, I took a walk with two of my close friends, and we decided to sit on the patch of grass to the right of the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library. The grass was wet, and it stained our pants and the soles of our shoes. I looked at my friends, their faces bright and alive in the premature summer light.
I belonged to something and it didn’t have a name.
When I first wrote for the News as a sophomore, I was driven by an acute sense of frustration with the need to advertise personal identity in campus discourse. I criticized its underlying assumptions as a dishonest way of refusing to learn about one’s peers, an inherently flawed stopgap that would stifle our conversations and deprive them of true insight. Ultimately, what drove me to speak up was my conviction that I had something to say that wasn’t being said in the open.
Recently, I found myself defending intersectionality as the only “woman of color” (said with more of a grimace than a wink) in a conference room full of conservatives who approved of doing away with it altogether, convinced that it did not benefit them. It struck me as incredibly hypocritical that, for their own discursive convenience, they were willing to occlude all potential good-faith efforts to grasp the complex differences between individuals in larger communities. Intersectionality, when done correctly, accomplishes exactly that — which would address the issue they allegedly protest.
Over these past few years, various debates on campus have finely dissected all the ways in which people of all backgrounds, on all points along the political spectrum, have been prohibited from speaking up. But sincere expression is, if Yale has taught me nothing else, of paramount importance for an undeniably diverse community.
Professors and peers alike here have modeled both productive communication and awareness of different limitations. From their example has come a humbling understanding that a history of risky speech and accommodating discomfiting subjects has long preceded current debates on campus. Family and friends, at Yale and elsewhere, have taught me how to reevaluate my thoughts and to listen better. Teachers have engaged and encouraged me and, once, even slipped me a kind note at a talk after I nervously asked a question.
Last year, Yale’s first undergraduate research conference took place at a time when I and other Yalies, with the shadow of recent political events hanging over us, were wrestling with the decision to pursue academia at the cost of more direct, effective routes to political advocacy. The conference’s keynote speaker was none other than our very own former Yale College Dean Jonathan Holloway. After a thoughtful and beautiful presentation on the history of African-American students, faculty and workers in institutions of higher education, he urged us to see the conference room as one of the truest pastures for progress. Concluding on a powerful note of encouragement, he asked us, “If you aren’t going to be in the room, who is?”
Over my four years, I have become increasingly of the mind that there is little excuse for — or at least a great deal of danger in — the abdication of speech, in one way or another. Many conservatives have become entirely too comfortable buying into the myth that they are an endangered breed on college campuses. They pitch jokes in liberal-free spaces, receding into boardrooms and ballrooms to bemoan the demise of free speech while helping to dig its grave, all the while pointedly ignoring the fact that bigotry marches side by side with challenges to free speech. Similarly, many liberals refuse to accommodate views that complicate an easily organized (and organizable) worldview, treating testimony as an exclusive advantage and claiming to empower unheard voices — except those they find inconvenient. In the worst cases, the stubborn refusal to speak betrays a distinct lack of humility. At this rate, who on earth is the table supposed to be for?
My time at Yale has introduced me to certain frustrating realities about the academy, about my generation, about modern American discourse. But it has also empowered me to speak up and carefully cultivate my thoughts, to notice which voices I have heard far too much from or not enough from at all. One of the most fruitful methods has been this biweekly News column, through which I have learned to interrogate moments of both certainty and discomfort while resisting the urge to equivocate — in short, to remain true to myself. (And, of course, making sure that my parents don’t fret too much over my columns.)
I could not be more grateful for all the insight these past four years here — at the News, in the Classics Department, in my residential college — have brought me toward realizing who I am, what I want to do and how to keep learning and listening after college. One of the most important things Yale can offer you is the time and the space to learn the art of reflection, to figure out why you think the way you do. Whether with friends, around a seminar table or even (God forbid) in a column, speak up — and speak to each other.
On Monday, 27 brave, righteous student protesters smiled and cheered as they received arrest citations for refusing to leave the Financial Aid Office after administrators chose not to capitulate to their demands to “eliminate the student income contribution.”
What a joke.
Argue for lower tuition. Argue for more flexible aid packages for middle income students. But please stop “arguing” for the elimination of a cost that doesn’t exist. In other words, argue for something that actually matters — if only we knew what that was.
Ironically, it appears that our generation has forgotten how to protest. Rather than question bureaucracy through reasoned discourse, careful rhetoric and detailed plans of action — hallmarks of the great protesters of the 1960s — we have instead turned the fight for supposed egalitarianism into inherited dogma. We’re “fighting” for things that really don’t make a difference.
While Students Unite Now could only shout “We believe that we will win” over and over outside administrators’ offices, Mario Savio, the famous University of California, Berkeley advocate for unfettered free speech, had much stronger words for a true and crucial purpose — one that furthered the University and recognized its failures. He spontaneously shouted these stirring lines against the administrative plutocracy that denied a plurality of viewpoints from campus: “You’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels … upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve got to make it stop! And you’ve got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you’re free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!”
It was the left, not the right, that wanted freedom of expression in the ’60s; that was the key, they thought, to true liberty. Students wanted every kind of speaker to represent a diverse array of views on campus. They wanted more classes and more class time — discussion sections, clubs. Everything was intellectual. The tenor at Yale is sharply different today — equality is sought through orthodoxy, not lively conversation.
The recent Yale College Council Presidential debate exhibits this well. Fires were stoked when two candidates responded “no” to the rapid-fire question, “Is Yale institutionally racist?” The fact that this question was considered simple enough to be reduced to a yes or no answer is laughable. The fact that only one of those answers was popularly considered “correct” is frightening.
The onslaught continued: Yale has failed to address sexual misconduct? Check. Mental health is a huge concern on campus? Check. Yale must eliminate the student income contribution? Well, duh, check.
While different policies are frequently proposed to address these stock issues, the existence of the issues themselves is always assumed. Hardly ever do we question those assumptions — borrowed from generations before us — and seek the deeper reasons for their existence (or lack thereof).
By voicing “no,” to the unfairly worded question, Sal Rao ’20, the YCC president-elect, actually did a great service to campus discourse. Her initial intuition, that people on campus have worked hard over the years to make the campus a better, more comforting place appropriately recognized the danger in quickly affirming a problem as “institutional” — as something that is disseminated throughout every facet of the University. Real progress at the university level — if that’s at all what any protester is interested in — will only come if we sincerely recognize how far Yale has already come.
Protesters of the ’60s would find today’s advocacy utterly meaningless. In 1962, Tom Hayden of Students for a Democratic Society began the “Port Huron Statement,” a 60-plus-page manifesto on the plight of America, with a humility and honesty completely lacking from today’s activism: “We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.”
Protesters recognized their relatively privileged positions in elite universities and instead turned their intentions to a place we often forget at Yale — the real world. The statement of Students for a Democratic Society outlined very specific and knowledgeable policy proposals against racial divides and McCarthyism that were backed by rigorous political theory. Later protesters of Vietnam poured their hearts into questioning the absence of meaning behind the government’s invasion.
Martin Luther King Jr. offers the most beautiful example of the height of reasoned discourse in his “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.” He invokes Socrates, St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas to argue for the reversal of a fundamental wrong committed against the very history of humanity itself.
The protesters of the ’60s were great because they were radical: They questioned the very roots of institutions. They sought to understand the purpose of a university, or a country, and offered rigorous solutions to entrenched absurdities.
We’ve gotten to a point in the University’s history where students have it so good that we can’t distinguish between what is and isn’t important. We can’t assume that we know what battles should be fought or what injustices should be corrected. We’re a far cry away from a meaningful shout.
If you don’t take care, graduate school can break your heart. The process of working for a doctoral degree is enormously difficult and stressful. You move to a new city where you don’t know anyone. You become dependent on the goodwill of a faculty advisor who’s both your mentor and your boss. You begin work on a long-term project that, by definition, will have unpredictable results. You become financially unstable and potentially career-insecure. And that’s the system at its best. What about the growing number of us — like me, a trans man — who somehow don’t fit the mold?
It’s no wonder, then, that there’s an extraordinary wave of demand for mental health and counseling in graduate schools across the country and at Yale. A recent study warned that “graduate students are more than six times as likely to experience depression and anxiety as compared to the general population.” This is as true here as anywhere. Eighty percent of graduate students seek mental health care while at Yale.
I’m an environmental engineer, and I work on projecting the future scenarios of society-wide environmental impacts. The pressures on scientists are ratcheting up year by year, as funding gets harder to obtain and academia becomes more competitive. We can all feel this ratchet. It makes me doubt myself, doubt my work, doubt whether I can make it here. I’ve worked to maintain my commitments —to myself, my work and to LGBTQ and racial justice activism. But it’s never easy.
I have a particular experience of mental health challenges as a trans man. Trans grad students are almost ten times likelier to experience anxiety and depression than the general population. Given the hostility in our society toward trans people, it never stops being a daily struggle — even here in New Haven. Just last year, a bus plastered with transphobic messages drove all around downtown and campus on Transgender Day of Visibility, trying to dehumanize us. We made our presence known at City Hall, highlighting our diverse community and ongoing struggles, on this year’s Day of Visibility at the end of March.
When I arrived in 2016, I knew I’d struggle. But when I went for my first intake appointment at Yale Health, the options for therapy were limited and confusing. I figured I should save up my quota for a time when I really needed it. A rationed system like the one available there in-house discourages people from seeking the care they need — that’s what it did to me.
Close friends arriving on campus with mental health diagnoses have waited months for appointments. I know many who haven’t sought care because the hurdles seem too high and the care is unreliable. I imagine that to meet so much demand is more expensive than Yale would like. But other institutions seem to manage it. Previously, I went to MIT, where it was straightforward to see the same therapist for several years running.
I was pleased this year that Yale began providing access to a broader pool of external therapists through the Magellan provider network — the system that other Yale staff use. Unlike with Yale Health, I was able to provide a list of criteria I wanted — someone who’d respect and understand where I was coming from.
I started seeing a therapist through Magellan in January, and we’ve built a trusting relationship. I’ve gotten a handle on some patterns in my relationships. I’ve made real progress and am taking better care of myself. But I was told that Magellan coverage, a stopgap, would end this summer.
So I participated in an organizing campaign. A group of us tabled, talked to peers, and collected over 100 comment cards for Yale Health on the importance of Magellan. We phone banked administrative offices seeking clarity, asking for Magellan to be made permanent and calling for a public announcement.
It was a welcome step forward when Director of Yale Health Paul Genecin wrote an email to the student body on Wednesday. He stated, “MHC will meet the growing need for services by continuing to refer some patients to community psychologists and clinical social workers through the Yale Magellan Mental Health network. Students may access this network of psychotherapists by referral from Yale Health.”
I applaud the administration for making the reasonable, humane choice to announce continued access to the Magellan network. But there are still some further steps to provide the necessary support system: It’s not yet clear if everyone will be eligible for Magellan going forward, or if the program will be genuinely permanent as opposed to year-to-year. Updating the website with clear, unambiguous language on these questions will allow me and the other 3,339 students who also sought care at MHC this year to breathe a sigh a relief.
It is no secret that many Yalies come from backgrounds that are highly privileged. Students coming from boarding schools, wealthy neighborhoods and households with highly educated parents have a variety of advantages when it comes to meeting traditional metrics of success. The pernicious part of this privilege is that students from backgrounds such as these will often come from environments that are effectively segregated by wealth. At private schools like Sidwell Friends or Horace Mann, for example, there may be some students on scholarships, but the vast majority will come from wealthy, white families. Even Yalies from public schools are likely to have attended either unusually wealthy schools, which receive high property tax revenues, or magnet schools, that are awarded disproportionately high levels of state funding.
All of this is to say that the average Yale student comes from a background that is inherently exclusive. In fact, access to these schools and neighborhoods have been deliberately kept from poor people and people of color through state and federal policy, as well as highly biased and selective admissions criteria. Yet, students from privileged backgrounds would be loath to say that their success came out of conscious acts of exclusion — or to attach any kind of guilt to their backgrounds which they never had a choice in, after all. Thus, to them, exclusion is a simply a fact of life which is rarely challenged. However, when it comes time for rush season at Yale, whether it be for a fraternity, sorority or senior society, I regularly hear some of these extraordinarily privileged students condemn the exclusiveness of undergraduate institutions. All of a sudden, the kind of exclusion which had previously guaranteed their success now seems poisonous.
One theory I’ve heard about these students’ sudden change of heart of is that they are mainly upset because this is one of the first times that they’ve been excluded from a prestigious group. After all, the concept of egalitarianism can seem much more attractive when you stand to be excluded due to an opaque selection process which you don’t control. Similarly, another complaint that I’ve often heard is that the interviewing processes for these exclusive organizations require applicants to be overly “performative.” This is ironic considering that much more harmful acts of exclusion are dangerous because they are so banal. In fact, they require very little effort on the part of the people participating in them. A teenager with plans to go to a boarding school which their family has attended for generations will likely never have to convince anyone that they belong there. After such an experience, having to convince a group of fellow undergraduates that you belong in their club would likely feel like a grievous insult.
Now, let’s analyze why exclusion is actually quite important in the context of social clubs. First, organizations have finite resources and can only open up to so many people before they are exhausted. Second, not everyone gets along very well and it’s foolish to expect people with conflicting personalities and interests to get along perfectly. Third, organizations have missions and certain people may not have values that align with those missions. Exclusion thus exists for very practical reasons. Honestly, this is quite intuitive. After all, a person rushing Delta Kappa Epsilon probably wouldn’t fit very well into the Fence Club, and vice versa.
Still, it’s no secret that these processes have been abused for quite some time. Well-connected and legacy students have an inherent advantage, and those with prestigious reputations coming into a place like Yale inevitably receive disproportionate attention. This is why an ethical interview process requires real competition which requires people to be “performative” and otherwise accentuate their best features and accomplishments. And still, even with a truly competitive system, privileged people will still have an advantage due to the number of opportunities they enjoy throughout their lives which will pad their resumes and make them seem “interesting.” But still, a competitive process is much better than a system where you get into an organization by virtue of your high school or your last name (it’s ironic, I know).
After school ends, most privileged Yale graduates will seek to achieve a standard of living equivalent to or better than the one they had growing up. They’ll seek to become more successful or wealthier than their parents and hope to give their children all the opportunities they had growing up and more. None of these actions will feel wrong or immoral in the slightest. But nonetheless, this is the way that cycles of exclusion and segregation operate. In a country where so many schools are segregated by race and wealth, most neighborhoods lack ethnic and economic diversity and an increasingly small group of people control financial resources. I would happily argue that our attention should be more focused on these types of exclusion rather than the exclusion which is necessary for the functioning of a society or a social club.
When I meet someone new at Yale, I usually ask a rather unconventional question: “What’s your story?” It’s a weird one — and as anyone who’s been on the other end of it over the last four years can tell you, it’s hard to answer. But somehow, every time I ask, I hear something new and meaningful.
With Commencement around the corner, I’ve often thought about what the most important part of my Yale experience was. I’m still not sure what the answer is, but hearing the life stories of others has been a huge part of it. Over the last four years, I’ve heard quite a few stories from students and staff on campus. I’ve heard the story of a woman who went from living in a small village in India to studying medieval Indian poetry at the largest research institutions in the world — an inspirational professor who happens to have taught me Hindi. I’ve heard the story of a man who bounced back and forth between Kenya and Connecticut, experiencing more than a few identity crises along the way. And I’ve heard the story of my roommate whose experiences growing up in California and studying computer science were simultaneously remarkably similar and fundamentally different from my own.
I’m not alone. Stories are one of the core aspects of the Yale experience; I’m sure all of us have had similar chance conversations in a buttery, hometown discussions in FOOT or something else entirely. And captured in our stories is that indescribable sparkle of Yale.
For me, engaging with stories means writing them down. So, I did: I joined the Yale Daily News as a staff opinion writer my first year on campus. Since then, my columns have been a public diary of sorts. And they’ve created stories of their own.
One night last year, I was sitting with a friend of mine on Cross Campus when we started talking about names. He mentioned how much of a point of pride it was for him when he finally became a U.S. citizen and legally changed his name from a traditional Korean name to a more Western one. To him, changing his name represented the final step in becoming American; he would no longer be an outsider. I was taken aback. For years, I’ve felt that in a nation of immigrants, my Indian name, Shreyas, is the most American name of all. The discussion that followed mattered to me, and I wrote a column about it. Pretty soon, I was flooded by emails from people around Yale and New Haven telling me about the background behind their own names and offering a variety of perspectives about how the words we use define our identities. I’ve never looked at a name the same way since.
And yet, every day that we respond to “How was break?” with a “Fine,” we rob ourselves of the opportunity to hear more of these stories. When you catch up with your friends on campus, please say more than that it was a “normal break.” What does normal even mean? Does it mean hiking through the hills of Palos Verdes, California? Does it mean stargazing in a small town in West Virginia? Tell them a more compelling story; you definitely have one.
It sounds like this is yet another column bemoaning the death of social engagement at Yale. And maybe it is. Complaining is what columnists do. There’s little work required: Just dish out 800-word criticisms of whatever your bugbear of the week happens to be and you’ll join the club. In some sense, we’re the spoilsports of Yale — the Debbie downers who manage to make Yale feel a little less magical and a little less perfect.
Perhaps that’s why the most common response I hear whenever I write a column tends to be, “What’s your problem this time?” It’s a good question. Rare is the column that appreciates rather than excoriates. And you know what, that’s probably fine. The venerable institutions that comprise the University are really just communities of teenagers and 20-somethings who have no idea what we’re doing. We mess up pretty often. Most columns are written as a good faith effort to keep us accountable, and this one is no exception. But this is also a column in which I appreciate how amazing the past four years have been.
In fact, this will be my last regular column for the News. Thank you to all the friends and random passersby on Cross Campus whom I’ve subjected to rants about campus culture at 1 a.m. These conversations and columns tell my story. What’s yours?
During the recent Yale College Council election, the question of institutional racism on campus sparked significant debate. As necessary as these conversations are, we should not forget how deeply racism operates in dictating our educational backgrounds prior to Yale. I know it certainly did for me, and I write this article as a white person not to detract from the voices of people of color, but rather to encourage my fellow white students to join me in thinking through our personal privileges and responsibilities.
While I have pondered this topic for the past several years, my most recent thoughts stem from The New York Times education journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones’ recent speech at Yale. The bulk of her talk focused on contemporary school segregation and the personal responsibilities of middle-class white parents. In essence, she urged these parents to enroll their children in low-income, predominantly minority schools, benefitting students of color by bringing privilege, resources and social capital into these environments. These dividends grow over time as white children develop interracial friendships and view people of color as authority figures, leading them to adopt a lifelong commitment to racial equity.
For me, this message resonated deeply. In societal discourse surrounding privilege and race, we often alternate between casting race in either a personal light or a systemic one. Yet, prior to Hannah-Jones’s talk, I had not adequately reflected on the link between these two levels. As white people, we should do more than pay attention to daily decisions to call out racism or listen to people of color. Rather, we have a social obligation to consider questions of race in larger life decisions such as where to live, work or send our children to school. Alone we may not be able to solve institutional racism and segregation, but each of us can slightly reduce it.
Thinking backwards, two specific contexts from my life illustrate the dire consequences remaining racially oblivious. First, during a high school summer, I served as a counselor at a camp program for children from low-income backgrounds who also happened to all be people of color. One student attended school with my younger sister, and we were discussing the prospect of her visiting them at the center one day. A boy who was around nine years old vehemently rejected the idea by proclaiming, “But she’s a white girl.” These five words broke my heart as it signifies that by age nine, these children had already noticed and started to internalize the realities of racism and segregation. In that moment, I understood it would only be a matter of a few short years before they would fully recognize the extent of societal prejudice. After Hannah-Jones’ talk, this memory also took on a new light as I realized that these students are the ones from her speech — the ones that many white parents desperately strive to avoid. This explicit or implicit racial or class prejudice then gets passed on down to their children, creating a detrimental cycle that continues to perpetuate massive inequities.
The other context for these issues is at Yale. Around 36.5 percent of the class of 2021 attended a private school, yet that is only true for nine percent of all U.S. students. While these Yale admissions statistics don’t break down school enrollment type by race, I strongly suspect that private school enrollment would be even higher for white students. And of course that doesn’t even take into account all of the white students here who attended highly segregated suburban public schools.
None of this is intended to make white students who attended these kinds of schools feel guilty or insinuate that you are immoral if you are white and enroll your future child in a private or suburban school. Rather, I merely wish to highlight that middle-class white individuals have the power to make large choices as well as small ones. We can reconsider our framework — perhaps high test scores and specialized academic programs aren’t the most essential components of an education.
Perhaps if the goal of education is truly to prepare children for American citizenry, it would be better if they learned anti-racism through being exposed to a diverse subset of students, faculty and administrators. Perhaps it is time to yield a little of our own personal privilege to stand in solidarity with people of color, to say that enough is enough and to prioritize the collective education system over our own children getting ahead. For I guarantee if your future children see you placing racial and class inclusivity over self-centered gains, they will become better people for it, and that means more than any set of test scores, any high income job, any quantitative metric of life outcomes. So, my fellow white students, I leave you with a question — when you reach critical life decisions, will you personally replace words with action and take steps towards a more racially equitable future?
In my first month at Yale, a senior suggested that if I wanted to see change in New Haven, I should just start doing things. At the time, I was scared and worried about the future of this country under President Donald Trump. I wanted to know who I should reach out to. Legislating seemed like the thing to do.
But I didn’t think I was the right person to “just start doing things.” I felt clumsy and naive, knowing I would be infringing on spaces that didn’t belong to me. My thinking still remains the same: I am young and the daughter of an academic with cultural capital. It’s true that I’m a woman of color and queer, but that’s only half the story. Just because I clearly see privilege permeating some of my reality doesn’t mean I catch it at every step. In truth, I have just stumbled into New Haven. In the fall, I had just begun to fall in love with New Haven’s seasons, the way the city brought me batches of fresh colors like saffron trees yet to lose their leaves and branches sagging with snow. Winter has taken me beyond the hems of Old Campus and Yale’s border into this small city and its complicated history. Living here for such a short period of time has taught me so much. I can only imagine how much I am missing of this city and how much I have left to learn about its contours and streets.
So, this past fall I didn’t start “doing things” on my own. I knew I would make mistakes, would be hurting someone somehow. I didn’t want to do that. I thought I might learn from the “experts,” so I joined the Yale College Democrats. I’ve learned a lot about politics and local legislative advocacy. This spring, I’ve done a lot of observing.
When my friend Carrie asked if we could organize something post-Parkland, my thinking hadn’t changed. I was still a first-year student, still learning how my privileges affect life in ways that, to me, are only starting to become visible. Hesitantly, I suggested we organize a vigil. We got together speakers, borrowed candles from the Chaplain’s office and made a Facebook event. People came to speak and it was truly moving. I felt so fulfilled to have helped, to know that I had done something to make this small gathering happen. I didn’t even know that I was capable of something like that. But vigils don’t end at mourning. They’re about what happens next.
Shortly after, we got together a group of students. We were discussing how the Parkland students’ high school education on gun policy made them the incredible activists they are. One senior, Brandon, suggested that we host a teach-in. He emphasized that it should be for New Haven and Yale students alike. Over the past month, me and an incredible group of students contacted organizations from Connecticut and New Haven. We’ve been in touch with high school and college students, advocacy organizations and local representatives.
Through it all, I’ve learned that my concerns were legitimate. I’ve been insensitive, spoken when I shouldn’t have and taken up space when I shouldn’t have. But this whole planning process has forced me to lean in to my discomfort. It has required that I accept that I’m going to make mistakes. But I know that people will push me. Brandon will suggest that instead of sending an aggressive email talking about how “we’re hosting an event” that I attend a few meetings and plant informal roots. Democratic Socialists of America will tell me about more New Haven organizations I haven’t heard about. Ala from Black Lives Matter will suggest that we offer a stipend to students and activists who speak at our event.
But I’m ready to learn, ready to apologize for and remember the mistakes I made. Next time, I’ll attend meetings instead of sending an email stating my position as a Yale student. Next time I’ll remember that, if possible, individuals who speak at an event should be given compensation because not everyone has the luxury of free time. Next time, I’ll do less talking and more listening. I’m thankful to be taught by people who see things I don’t so that one day I’ll see them too.
What has changed, really, between last semester and now? Now I see sometimes you do have to start doing things. Sometimes, you have to make mistakes so you can learn the right way to be a better citizen. Especially here at Yale, it would be easy for me to sit back and do nothing. But I want New Haven to do well because of, not in spite of Yale. And that’s never going to happen if we don’t accept that we’re going to be wrong sometimes. We just have to be ready to learn.
Last month, the University announced that the Yale College term bill will increase by 3.8 percent, in keeping with recent trends. Despite a decade of austerity, which has included layoffs, hiring freezes and across-the-board budget cuts, the University continues to operate under the presumption of fiscal restraint. Yet, college costs climb at more than twice the inflation rate: In today’s dollars, tuition alone has increased from $35,688 in 1998 to $53,430 in 2018. While the University deserves credit for its commitment to need-based financial aid, what can possibly explain this paradox?
Despite the University’s lack of budget transparency, we can infer two broad reasons for the cost explosion. First, Yale has seen an exponential rise in the number of middle managers and student life professionals. At the very top of the scale, compensation for senior administrators has also increased dramatically. In 1999, in the seventh year of his term, University President Richard Levin earned $525,687, or about $770,000 in today’s dollars. In 2015, in the third year of his term, President Salovey took home $1.4 million. This occurred even as faculty salaries at Yale declined over the last decade, relative to faculty salaries at peer institutions.
Second, Yale, like other colleges, has added a dazzling array of facilities. From pottery studios in college basements to touchscreens in the Center for Teaching and Learning, new amenities cost money to build, staff and maintain. Many of these amenities enrich the student experience and are at least in part funded by donor contributions. Still, the real question is not whether they are beneficial, but whether they are worth the cost.
Meanwhile, the “hidden” costs of college have also increased. In many industries, especially the culture and nonprofit sectors, unpaid summer internships have become a prerequisite for a full-time job. While the Domestic Summer Award represents a laudable attempt to mitigate this reality, I fear it will only normalize and entrench the practice. Unpaid placements not only hurt students from poorer backgrounds and institutions, but also drag down wages for entry-level jobs.
Cumulatively, these forces threaten the future of higher education. Psychologically, students are more likely to see their education as an investment and to adopt the mindset of an entitled consumer. Coupled with earlier and earlier recruitment cycles, they are more likely to accept lucrative jobs in finance and consulting, rather than embark on careers for the public good.
Once the bastion of social mobility, a liberal arts education feels increasingly inaccessible to the vast majority of Americans (“UP CLOSE: Tearing down the ivory tower,” April 12, 2018). As a result, public support for higher education has ebbed. Despite Yale’s generous financial aid and extensive outreach efforts, the reality is that it is no longer possible to deliver a liberal arts education at scale.
Make no mistake: I believe Yale College offers one of the best undergraduate educations in the world. Some of its features, like the libraries and museums, cannot be easily replicated. But the core of a liberal arts education should be an option for the many, not the few. Once upon a time, many state schools had thriving programs in the humanities and the arts. Budget cuts have rendered that an elusive past. Unless elite schools take the lead in managing the costs of college, they will find themselves increasingly isolated in the higher education landscape.
Given the inertia at a large institution like Yale, the best way to improve college access might be to explore alternative modes of delivery. We have already invested in Open Yale Courses, but we can do more. From programs for veterans and classes in prisons, to taking in more transfer students, Yale can provide funding and support for radically new ways of sharing the treasure that is a liberal arts education.
And, for all its idiosyncrasies, Yale-NUS College could point to ways of managing the cost of a liberal arts education. Without the Singapore government’s tuition grant, international students at Yale-NUS pay about $52,000 for tuition, room and board. That’s almost 20 grand less the sticker price of Yale, which should prompt us to consider what the startup is doing differently. By experimenting at the periphery, we can reinvent the core.
College access is not just an economic question, but an ethical imperative. University trustees have a fiduciary responsibility to the institution, but all of us also have a moral responsibility to the future. Until we take decisive action on the question of college affordability, we will continue to talk a big game of inclusion, while underwriting an unsustainable status quo.
Swing Space got a bad rap. Last year, when people asked me where I lived, I became accustomed to responses of groans and pity frowns. It’s so sterile, and it’s so far, people would say. “Doesn’t it look like a dorm?” In response, I became Swing Space’s biggest advocate. “Air-conditioning,” I said, and “I have a bathtub, too.” “Walk-in closet and proximity to Payne Whitney Gym,” I’d laugh — though I really cared only about one of those two.
But somewhere along the way, I began to mean it. I loved Swing Space, officially Baker Hall. Built in 1931 for nonresidential law school facilities, the building was morphed into Swing Space in 1998 to house undergraduates during residential college renovations. It served as overflow housing until last year, when the law school began renovating it to serve as on-campus accommodations for law students. All the rooms were apartment-style doubles — two enormous singles plus a common room, a kitchenette and an in-suite bathroom. Unlike most Yale students who have never transferred residential colleges, I’ve lived in a different place each year: L-Dub as a Berkeley freshman, Berkeley College as a sophomore, Swing Space in annex housing and, this year, off campus.
I feel the most nostalgic for Swing Space. When I walk past Grove Street Cemetery, I mourn dear Baker Hall with it, fondly remembering the walks back from campus to my comfortable refuge on Tower Parkway.
Swing Space solved two problems, and it could have solved a third. First, it provided just the right amount of off-campus living that I sought. I never wanted to move off campus, but I was ready to get space from Cross Campus and to feel some separation from the center of student life, to feel I could go home at the end of the day and be apart from Yale. I loved having a kitchenette, though I rarely used it, and having lots of space was enough to console me that I was annexed from my residential college. It gave me just the small amount of independence I sought, without sacrificing much. The six-minute walk from Berkeley College was worth it, giving me the solace and alone time I’d never even realized I needed as a classically extroverted Yalie.
In a counterintuitive way, too, living in Swing Space likely kept me in my residential college. Had I been a sophomore when the new colleges opened themselves up to transfers, I probably would have left. Instead, I learned how to be a part of it without living in it, because I still lived on campus but not in the college itself. I went back for family dinners, special college events and to use its facilities. Now, though there are fewer reasons to go back as an off-campus student, I still very much feel that Berkeley is my college. Though I’m not the most rah-rah Berkeley student, I know that in a few short weeks at Commencement I will feel that it’s the right place for me to be receiving my diploma. It’s been a constant, though evolving, during my four years.
Swing Space also could have solved one final problem: living with students from other colleges without transferring. That was my primary motivator to move off campus. With the advent of the new colleges, transfers have spiked, and it appears more normal to transfer multiple times at Yale. But I feel more attached to Berkeley than any other college, and I didn’t want to leave just because the person I hoped to live with is in Timothy Dwight. Swing Space could have allowed for students from different colleges to live together, to stay affiliated with their colleges and stay on campus without living in college-specific housing.
Swing Space, of course, is not a viable option, but perhaps its lessons can endure. One is that many students do, indeed, want to live on campus, whether or not the residential college system in its purest form is the way they want it. As I mourn 100 Tower Parkway in the nostalgic daze of my final weeks here, I propose imaginativity for on-campus housing beyond the residential college suites. The possibilities range from investing in apartment-style suites to allowing for intercollege housing. As Yale considers what to do about the off-campus flight and the spike in residential college transfers, I posit that though Swing Space is dead, the opportunity for on-campus flexibility and the lessons of annex housing can live on.
On Monday, the three of us, as brothers, along with over 20 other students, sat in at the Office of Financial Aid and demanded that the Yale administration end the student income contribution. We were unflinching in our demand, refusing to leave until Yale agreed to eliminate the student income contribution. Our message was impossible to ignore: We are done waiting. Yale must eliminate the student income contribution. Instead, Yale administrators decided that they would rather arrest their students than listen to us.
As three brothers simultaneously attending Yale, our experience with the student income contribution is inextricable from our family’s experience. We come from a family whose expected family contribution is $0. Our parents raised us with the understanding that we, as low-income students of color, would have to work especially hard to prove that we belonged at a place like Yale. As working-class students, to excel academically at Yale is a matter of survival, a way to escape the financial insecurity that has plagued our family. To our family, having three children attend Yale on need-based scholarships was proof that our hard work paid off and offered hope that we would not have to endure the financial struggles we have faced growing up.
We soon realized, however, that being accepted into Yale was not going to ease stress in the way that Yale promised us that it would. Yale instead imposed new financial burdens. Through the student income contribution, the Yale administration singles us out, telling working-class students like us that our presence at Yale is on sufferance. Unlike Yale, our family understands that we deserve to be here, and that we have so much more to offer to academic, extracurricular and social life at Yale. This has forced our family to make one of two sacrifices: Either the three of us lose the opportunity for a full Yale experience, or our family incurs a cost — a cost that Yale already determined it could not afford. Our family has decided to pay three student income contributions so that we can value our education the way they raised us to. Our parents and grandparents all contribute to our student income contributions because they understand that the time spent working would make it impossible for us to focus on the experiences that make a Yale education valuable.
We walked into the Financial Aid Office and sat down because we are tired of the Yale administration telling us that our situation doesn’t affect our family. Puerto Rican families like ours treat any burden on one family member as a burden on the entire family, so it is absurd for Yale to suggest that there can ever be a family contribution of $0 while students still have to pay. To Yale, a contribution of a few thousand dollars is insignificant, but to my family, a few thousand dollars means struggling more with bills, being unable to save for retirement and providing less for our younger siblings still at home.
Yale will tell us that our experiences are invalid or an exception to rule, but the reality is that low-income students of color are faced with a choice: work to prove you deserve your Yale education or pay the price to focus on academics, no matter if your loved ones incur that burden. Until the student income contribution is eliminated, low-income students and their families will continue to make impossible choices that they should not have to make. We sat in because Yale has the power to remove financial burdens from our family, other working-class students and the people who will still have to pay the student income contribution after we graduate. The way to create a better Yale is by standing — or sitting — together and not letting the administration divide us from each other and our families. We have showed Yale that we will fight for each other in love and solidarity, and together we shouted loudly and clearly: The student income contribution must end.
The college housing draws are over. The cool, alt kids and the wealthy socialites have moved off campus; housing groups have fallen apart, with their constituent parts restructuring like an insolvent company; and some groups have managed to stay together for some unimaginable length of time (I’m talking longer than a year here). As for me, I found myself among the elect few selected to pick first in the category draw. While I’m sure getting first pick would be a boon anywhere, Jonathan Edwards College junior housing is notoriously bad. In fact, JE junior housing is so bad, (hold your breath for a yo’ mama joke), we used to have our own annex housing on Old Campus: McClellan Hall. But in its infinite wisdom, the University is turning McClellan into classroom space to accommodate the increased number of students entering Yale (because it’s always a good idea to admit more students than space can accommodate). What does that mean for JE juniors who can’t live in the college due to lack of space?
It meant, for a while, that those unlucky enough to be annexed would live in Vanderbilt Hall, infamous for its doubles-only layout. But in an interesting turn of events, several JE juniors will now live in Branford, our supposed rival. They will live among Branford students, eat in the Branford dining hall (or not, because who would?) and become quasi-Branfordians. Some might laud the benefits of such a change: hot breakfast in the mornings, rooms that are mostly singles and the opportunity to become a part of an entirely new community. But this decision, facilitated by the Yale College Dean’s Office, is a stunning betrayal of the spirit and tradition of the residential college system.
Imagine choosing Yale for the residential colleges, those microcosms of campus life and your “home” for the next four years, and then being forced to move to a different one. When we are told that we will not only live in a different college, but in our rival college, and that we should be grateful for all of the benefits accompanying that change, we can only conclude that save for a select few, no one, not even the Yale College Dean’s Office, cares about the guiding ideal behind the residential college system.
A guest columnist said it best when he wrote that residential college living at Yale was never merely about having a space to live; it was about “fostering deep and lasting fidelity to one’s college, a respect for the challenges and benefits of communal living and a kind of residential republicanism” (SCHICK: “Our broken college system,” October 9, 2017). How can we ever hope to come close to achieving that ideal when we don’t even live in our proper colleges?
A student I know that best exemplifies that ideal, lovingly called “the King of JE,” will be living in Branford next year. Sad! More than sad, it’s tragic: not just what happened to my friend but also that this column will probably be met with a resounding “Who cares?” I get it — Branford doesn’t feel like a rival. But it wasn’t always this way. I once met an alumna from the ’70s or ’80s who asked what college I was in. “I’ve never met someone in JE that I liked,” she jokingly said after my response. We won’t have these moments in the future because no care has been taken to ensure that a healthy rivalry exists between Branford and JE. In our college’s first-year handbook, lovingly prepared in another era, exists the following entry: “Intense Dislike of Branford College: We do this a lot. They are our rivals — arch-nemeses if you will. Think Hatfields and McCoys.” What a joke.
Without the tradition of our residential college system, what’s to stop us from becoming like students at Columbia or New York University, perennially preoccupied with space, or lack thereof, as opposed to the community that we we’re privileged to be a part of? When students are annexed to entirely different colleges, not only are they losing out on the community of their college but the community is also lesser without them. It isn’t just a disservice to principle or tradition; it’s a disservice to students in, and now out, of the college.
Even if I haven’t made a strong enough case for figuring out an annex situation more in line with the tradition of the residential colleges, I’m left with a single hope: The next time administrators betray the spirit of the residential colleges and force us to live somewhere else, can we at least be placed somewhere nice? I’m thinking Benjamin Franklin or Pauli Murray.
In an essay I had written in my first semester at Yale, I brimmed with gritty optimism, writing, “If I must work twice as hard to get half as much, I’ll work ten times harder. Ceilings exist to be broken.” As a kid, I’d been assured that hard work will take you as far as your dreams can imagine. Now, midway through college, I’ve clung stubbornly to the same determination. My optimism, however, has slipped.
Recently, the student income contribution has received a fresh wave of attention, spurred in part by the race for Yale College Council presidency. For that, I’m glad, and I hope the administration engages in the kind of aid reform that allows all low-income students access to a Yale experience unsullied by financial burden. But students and faculty, this community itself, also have immense agency in the work they can do to address class: all the subtle cues that alienate students outside of income alone.
When David Brooks published a column last summer on class, Yale students roundly criticized him for his anecdote about soppressata and a gourmet sandwich shop. However, campus conversation is laced with similar cultural signifiers, whether its an expectation that you’ve come here with taste in clothing or philosophical literature or our obsession with exclusivity in extracurricular clubs and social circles. Fifty Most, despite its self-proclaimed irony and satirical nature, featured a cast of largely wealthy students. Even lauded performing arts groups, though talent-based, often operate in the unspoken transaction of social currency that leaves many first-generation, low-income students behind.
Professors, too, participate in social alienation. First, many seminars judge participants on the presentation of an argument, couched in Yale language, rather than the content itself. Some have offered critiques of papers that question students’ ability to speak English or invited students to pricey meals that low-income students cannot afford. Though research shows that first-generation students are less confident in requesting a professor’s time outside of class, few professors actively reach out to students and lower that barrier for contact.
A week ago, I received some exams back where I’d performed particularly poorly, on top of being exhausted by my job and other academic demands. For the first time, I went back to my room and cried. I felt alone, and scared: The grades played into a broader anxiety about my socioeconomic mobility. In some ways, it was a purely emotional reaction; my rational mind asked whether I’d care about these exams in five years, and the answer was clearly no. But, like the novelist Kazuo Ishiguro’s characters — many of whom navigate between two different worlds — I often feel that a single bad move could be calamitous for achieving the future I want. Ishiguro describes how a chess player, making a mistake in an important game, has “this panic because you don’t know yet the scale of the disaster you’ve left yourself open to.”
At Yale, I’m close enough to the elite world to understand the value of connections, of being inside the network, of what social status means. Yet in many ways, I’m searching for a way to the top without access to the inside track. With a greater awareness of the role that social capital plays in the world at large, the stakes of my performance seem to be constantly rising. In the pursuit of class-passing, my academic and activity-based qualifications have to make up for where I’m lacking in social cues. Meanwhile, I am also aware of the opportunity cost of time spent on academics over social climbing because the latter now has value I formerly did not recognize, in the real world of power and money.
Over dinner one night, another student and I pondered over this dilemma, especially as achieving social capital often seems so nebulous and vague. Maybe, he suggested, moving too high up the ladder is too much to ask for. Maybe it’s our job to make it to the middle class, and let our kids — whom we can dress in Patagonias and send to good schools and give the confidence that we’re still learning — advance past us.
Maybe this glass ceiling is one that we can’t break, but still, I don’t want to settle. In that first-year application essay, I wasn’t looking for a life with a ceiling: I also wrote that I sought “a future unrestricted” where I can push power to improve people’s lives worldwide.
Perhaps the student income contribution can’t change without the Yale administration. But the gatekeepers to the inside track are in this community that ought to be one, supportive home. So while I’m willing to work ten times as hard, while we demand aid reform, let us also hold ourselves accountable. Let us change the norms so those who enter in the future find class-passing less of a difficult game.
Since last month’s school shooting in Parkland, Florida, I, along with hundreds of thousands of people across the country, have been immensely impressed by the poise, composure and courage of the students leading the March for Our Lives movement. These teenagers have engaged intelligently with one of the most historically complicated debates in American politics and have challenged powerful people and the special interests that fund them. Yet commentators on social media, television and in newspapers have repeatedly characterized them as rude and overly emotional grandstanders.
I agree that it is important to not resort to hyperbole and scare tactics when we talk about guns. That’s the National Rifle Association’s job. But talking about mass shootings is not a scare tactic; mass shootings are just scary. Hiding from a shooter who was once your classmate is scary. Wondering if your kids will come home from school is scary. Wondering if your parents survived their day at work is scary, too. I know this because I grew up in Blacksburg, Virginia, in the shadow of the third deadliest mass shooting in American history. Eleven years ago today, Virginia Tech student Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people with two semi-automatic handguns. My parents, both professors at the university, were on campus that day and lost colleagues, friends and students. I was lucky to come home from lockdown to find both of them alive, but some of my classmates were not so fortunate.
I know firsthand that these mass tragedies do not just make people “understandably distraught.” They end lives, they change lives and they change communities. And the Parkland students are responding to their tragedy by trying to change policy. These students are not calling for “overreaching legislation,” nor are they threatening the rights of law-abiding gun owners. In fact, in a recent interview, March for Our Lives leader Cameron Kasky said that he lives in a gun-owning home but that his family “lives on the principle that there are some guns that are made to protect your family … and there are some guns that are made for war.”
It’s these military-grade assault weapons, guns that are designed to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible, that the Parkland students have focused on banning. In Parkland, it took 6 minutes and 20 seconds for Nikolas Cruz to kill 17 people with an AR-15. The Sutherland Springs shooter used an assault rifle. So did the Vegas shooter, the Pulse shooter, the San Bernardino shooter, the Newtown shooter and the Aurora shooter. The federal assault weapons ban went into effect in 1994. In the following decade, 89 people died in gun massacres (defined as shooting incidents resulting in at least six deaths). In the ten years since the ban lapsed in 2004, 302 people have died in gun massacres. Banning military-grade assault weapons is not the solution to America’s gun violence problem, but it would target the one common denominator that unites the past decade’s deadliest mass shootings.
Initially, I too was skeptical about the March for Our Lives, not because of the Parkland students’ proposals, but because of the populations they represent. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is located in an affluent area, as was Sandy Hook Elementary School. My hometown of Blacksburg is also predominantly white and predominantly middle class. While these communities have been irreparably shaken by the tragedy of mass shootings, there are many communities where gun violence is routine and expected. Over Memorial Day weekend in 2017, 52 people were shot in Chicago, over twice as many as were shot in Parkland. These shootings do not spark national movements, celebrity donations or a march in Washington. But the March for Our Lives organizers acknowledged their own privilege and included voices from urban communities of color in the march. Edna Chavez, a 17-year-old resident of South Los Angeles spoke, telling the crowd that “I learned to duck bullets before I learned to read.” Eleven-year-old Naomi Wadler talked about a black female high school student who had been shot and killed after Parkland, saying, “For far too long, these black girls and women have been just numbers.”
I would guess that every student at Yale has been affected by gun violence. Some of us come from small towns that, like mine, have been rocked by mass tragedy. Others of us have lost classmates, friends and family to gun-related accidents, suicides or homicides. And nearly all of us have hidden under desks or in closets during the active shooter drills that have become a routine of American schooling. These are the experiences that make us the mass shooting generation. When I marched in Washington, I did take a picture. But not just for Instagram. I took a picture to document the moment when our generation stood up and said they’d had enough.

Editor’s note: This article was published in the April 16 print issue. 
I used to wonder how world leaders and top executives flaunted Ivy League degrees but lacked the basic manners we learned in kindergarten. But now headlines about politicians taunting each other with petty names or CEOs sexually harassing employees no longer faze me. This isn’t because I’ve become desensitized to them — quite the contrary, I’ve witnessed this indecency firsthand.
Hopes were high for the people I would meet in college, assuming that those who looked good on paper would also have decent character. I anticipated that the “well-rounded” student admissions officers search for meant well-rounded in every way, not just academically and professionally, but in terms of integrity, too. The empathy intrinsic to service work we put on college applications does not seem to carry over to our social interactions.
We see our fellow classmates self-identifying as human rights activists and social justice warriors with the token goal of “making a difference,” all with impressive efforts. But with a simple change of scene, somewhere between classrooms and dining halls, suites and frat houses, the empathetic facade falls away. People no longer need to hide behind shiny resumes and political statements — the thick air, blaring beats and dark rooms shadowed the hypocrisy I observed as the dim light exclusively illuminated revealing scenes that left me deeply disappointed. Friends and colleagues abandoning their visibly uncomfortable peers in favor of potential romantic prospects or simply harassing others. Yet the next day, these same people were unapologetically organizing marches and charity events. Too often, I encounter this caveated empathy. If we can’t even be there for those closest to us, how can we expect ourselves to lead social justice initiatives around campus, let alone the world?
We’re all destined for greatness — that’s the rhetoric that has surrounded us since that blue folder came in the mail. We become more and more preoccupied with macro-level initiatives pushing us to devalue the hours we spend building personal relationships and causing us to believe that spending time with a distressed friend is a waste. We then resort to activism as it affords some sort of elevated status and in our minds, lets us check the “good-person box” while also allowing us to pad our resumes. This leads us to be hesitant to dismiss people’s questionable personal behavior simply due to their prominence, and so character becomes the last criterion by which we judge someone. We get so caught up in the appearances of social change that we forget that some of the most important changes we can make come in our day-to-day interactions. Our activism becomes meaningless if we can’t even treat our peers with basic respect.
By sophomore spring, my disillusioned self decided to rush a sorority. Initially, I enjoyed the rush process, meeting a variety of new people and engaging in small talk. I loved projecting the charming, friendly version of myself with everyone reciprocating. This surface-level acquaintanceship was easy as I didn’t have to deal with the complexities and hardships of close friendship. But I realized I didn’t necessarily need new friendships — I was happiest devoting my energy into my imperfect, yet undoubtedly worthwhile ones, letting myself get to know people on a deeper level. By the same token, I felt as though empathizing with and listening to someone made me more of an activist than being a club board member, retweeting a news article or supporting a campus initiative.
Kindness seems like a simple concept yet somehow difficult for top students to grasp. But people don’t fall into binary categories of “good” and “bad.” We’re motivated by a complex array of factors, but ultimately many sacrifice depth of character for their own advancement. It’s easy to condemn heinous wars but challenging to emotionally invest in and empathize with the person next to you. The latter requires time and energy most of us are short of, leaving us to make tough choices between our future success and meaningful connections. Looking at others’ achievements, we lose confidence, compensating with our activism while failing to recognize that the biggest foe is our own insecurity.
Maybe I’m being naive — it’s tempting to be pessimistic as we can’t expect ourselves to be perfect moral arbitrators, but the instances of greatest empathy and genuine activism often go unrecognized. Little steps go a long way, from walking an uncomfortable friend from a party to checking on a suitemate’s well-being. I’m afraid that if we don’t check questionable behavior now, we’ll let indecency endure, allowing for another generation of hypocritical leaders. It’s our duty to assess people by their character early on if we want to have hope for our future. Before we tackle the big world problems discussed in class, we must make sure we’ve looked out for the people right in front of us.

In his first address to Yale first years as president, University President Peter Salovey spoke movingly of the upward mobility that his family has enjoyed thanks to American higher education. His father was born to working-class immigrants in New York. Growing up, he was encouraged by his immigrant parents to study and work hard, and he was able to attend City College, then Harvard for a doctorate. “All of this education — all of it! — was without financial cost to my father’s family,” noted President Salovey.
I was told Yale would be the same way for me. Like President Salovey’s father, I’m the child of immigrants who taught me to work hard. My mother is a scrub nurse in a hospital and is the sole earner in my family — my dad’s body can’t take working anymore after years of restaurant jobs. So when I applied to college, my mom pushed me to apply to Yale. She knew I’d get the best financial aid at institutions like this one. (The days of free public college like the one President Salovey’s dad enjoyed are, of course, long gone.) Yale even waived the application fee — that seemed like a good sign.
But Yale is not the financial open door it presents itself as to students. I work three jobs here right now; at other times, I’ve worked up to four. This is because of Yale’s policies.
Although I’m on full financial aid, like many students from working- and middle-class backgrounds here, I have to pay the Student Income Contribution. It’s thousands of dollars each year, and it’s only expected of those of us on financial aid — it’s supposed to be our skin in the game. Yale, in other words, isn’t actually like the City College that President Salovey’s father attended; At that institution, fees were nominal to nonexistent, low enough that you could easily work them off if you had to pay them at all. The SIC, though, is a different story: It’s a story of how social inequality isn’t just something happening out there, in New Haven or all of America. It’s happening inside Yale’s walls. Yale has designed a fee to single out the people who couldn’t be here without the University’s generosity, to make sure we know who we are.
When I got to Yale, I didn’t have any income at all. Buying textbooks was a huge source of stress because I had a little money in my bank account and no way of replenishing it. Sometimes my friends would go out to eat or on a trip and I couldn’t join them.
I started doing data entry work at the Peabody Museum in my first spring at Yale and kept at that for a year. But then the SIC went up and I realized I had years more of these fees to pay. So I started getting more jobs. I’m a peer liaison at the LGBTQ Center, which I also work to staff. I have a job in a lab, thanks to a science professor who advocated for me. And I work at the sustainability office, where — more or less — I sort through trash.
There’s a cap on how many hours I’m allowed to work, and I stress a lot about it. I need the money, so I want to work as many hours as I can. But it takes a toll on my ability to be a regular Yale student. I’ve had to scale back my involvement in the LGBTQ Co-Op, Trans at Yale, Broad Recognition and immigration activism. Because it’s people from historically marginalized communities who are likelier to be on financial aid and thus responsible for the SIC, the policy has the effect of weakening community at Yale for those of us who need it most. In addition to extracurricular commitments, many people on financial aid need to be spending our money and time supporting financially precarious loved ones.
It also makes it hard to be the kind of student I want to be; sometimes I feel like I don’t even go to Yale. I can never go to office hours because I’m working during the day, which means I miss out on faculty support that I really need as an engineering major. I’ve noticed that, while I’m busy enough that I occasionally sleep through a class or miss an assignment, I’m always on time for work shifts. Because I’m tired, it takes me longer to get my work done, I stay up late finishing it, and the cycle repeats.
With the SIC, Yale is betraying the spirit that President Salovey hailed in his speech — the possibility of upward mobility through higher education. The fee is a roadblock in my path. I’ll work and I’ll get past it, but I want to pull it down for those coming after me.
“Just walk through that door and go up the stairs,” one of the dining hall workers assures me. I’m skeptical, largely because the door says “EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY, ALARM WILL SOUND IF DOOR IS OPENED.”
But, I mean, when you’re promised lunch with Dean of Yale College Marvin Chun, sometimes you’ve got to break the rules. I mentally prepare myself to ruin lunch for everyone in the Trumbull dining hall as I edge open the door but am greeted by silence and a set of stairs soaked in shadows.
Eventually, I find the room. As Dean Chun sits down amidst a handful of students, the volley of question and answer begins, friendly at some points and frustrated in others. One of the girls asks about the Student Income Contribution and whether the administration has made progress on the issue. Visibly frustrated about President Peter Salovey’s recent remarks that student employment is good for building student confidence and self-reliance, as well as statements that “no one is forced to work since students can take out loans,” she pushes back against Dean Chun and his office.
As the anger mellows, I ask Dean Chun to clarify what exactly the student income contribution is. Is it, as most students think it is, money that Yale has and would give in financial aid but takes away to encourage work? Or is it money that Yale wouldn’t give you in financial aid anyways and an arbitrary term they use to divide up the money that you would be paying regardless?
If what Dean Chun said to me that Friday afternoon is true, then it is the latter. The student income contribution means that Yale was going to give you $60,000 in aid anyways and then arbitrarily divides up the remaining $6,000 or so into parent and student contributions. It’s not that they were going to give you $60,000, then reduced it to $55,000 so that they could label the reduction the student income contribution.
The lunch continued, with issues like extended dining hall hours coming up. Over the next hour, I listened to Dean Chun express his own frustration with Yale’s inability to enact certain changes. He explains to us that extending dining hall hours is almost impossible due to the union contract and would cost too much. Yale Dining already runs at a deficit because a college our size should only have three dining halls.
More often than not, the Yale administration paints Yale College students as a tidal wave of unjustified anger, over issues from dining hall hours to the student income contribution to the renovation of Commons. But our anger is about more than these issues — it’s about the administration’s unwillingness to engage with us on them, answering our concerns directly. Aside from sparsely publicized town halls and lottery-based lunches with the Dean, few of us get answers to our questions from Dean Chun or his office, which handles everything related to Yale College. If you don’t want us to be angry, provide us with facts and answers to our questions, rather than treating us as children who are angry for nothing.
Some ways that the Yale College Dean’s Office could approach direct communication with students include college-wide emails with facts and explanations or regularly scheduled town halls. Dean Chun’s job is by no means easy, filled with both just and unjust criticism on the part of frustrated students. But providing students with facts about the issues that affect us and explaining hot-button issues would likely alleviate that line of fire, making things easier for his office and Yale students at large.
A stellar example of this is Provost Ben Polak’s Yale-wide email sent this Thursday, in which he thoroughly outlined infrastructure projects that Yale is currently pursuing, specifically underground ones. I, for one, took interest in finally getting information about the Schwarzman Center, especially in specifics of what spaces it will have and what it will be used for, a question that has largely been responded to with silence. (The email was also a work of art on its own, ending with, “We celebrate the parts that rise above the surface, but some of our greatest treasures are hidden underground.”)
The majority of Yale College students will graduate without having lunch with the Dean, or having to push through an emergency exit door to do so. However, if the Dean’s Office commits to transparency and head-on engagement with the student body, then maybe this campus will be filled with less anger, fewer myths and more fact-based dialogue. It’s high time we brought facts and dialogue out of the shadows.
I had intended, in my penultimate column, to suggest a tweak to Yale’s approach to the public by offering a realizable, practical way the University could be more civic. This column was supposed to be an argument. It is not. I realized that the source of my criticism was actually just a way to hold on to one of the things I love most about being here. For once, some unfettered praise.
My intended argument was straightforward: Open Yale syllabi to the public. Similar to Yale’s videotaped “Open Yale Courses,” the University should open all syllabi to welcome people outside the academy into the conversation. This would melt the opacity of academia. A syllabus is a lens through which to think about a topic, an iceberg tip hewn off by a professor who is leading her field and already understands the broadest scope of the conversation. It is a distillation to render a nuanced conversation both digestible and communicable.
I recognize that syllabi are the result of months of preparation by professors. Yet I believe — I certainly hope — that most professors also want to expand access to knowledge past our moats. Knowledge is, fundamentally, power, and keeping our syllabi close to our chests sequesters knowledge from the public. Without a syllabus, academia seems too insurmountably immense to enter alone. Yale, as a site of knowledge production, has a civic duty to engage with the public by communicating our internal conversations to the world.
That was the column I had intended to write. Nice, right? We should totally do it. But that column hinges on the assumption that if you read all the materials presented on the syllabus, then you will understand the conversation around a specific topic.
In so assuming, I failed to understand the central function of syllabi, as a syllabus is not just a book list. Instead, it is an invitation to an extended, thoughtful conversation. We are not in a university of autodidacts, which is both a strength and a fault of Yale. Instead, we learn through conversations here — over dinner, over seminar, over dates, over and over and over again. This is a place of exchange, not just a site of encounter. Thus, a syllabus is an opportunity for a triangulated conversation between you, the material and your peers, a way to learn that is both social and individual. That is what I think I might miss the most.
The heart of our undergraduate liberal arts education is fundamentally a conversation, albeit one of many different varieties. It might be a tasting menu, flitting from one academic conversation to another. It may be a deep dive into a topic, a conversation whose contours are explored by exhausting the course offerings in your major. It might be a conversation that comes second to your social conversations as you lead clubs and develop friendships. Regardless of the avenue, a university is a place to learn what you want to talk about, how you want to think through that development and how you act in a conversation.
Like all other second semester seniors, I am standing on the precipice of graduation. I understand that most of us will not be learning in this way again for a while, if at all. There is an impracticality about some academia that is both beautiful and also quarantined here, and we will tap out of that conversation. But we will also tap out of conversations that arise from a shared understanding of what it means to be here. There are no other places where everyone has proverbially read the same books before they sit down at the table.
But still. There is something profound about having spent four years when your primary goal was to think better by thinking together, when speaking with requisite preparation was, itself, a civic action. As our intellectual worlds after graduation will have fewer guidelines and fewer stopgaps, we will have to learn how to continue learning without a map, a captain or a surveyor.
That is a good thing. It actually is a great thing. The most necessary way to grow after college is to learn other ways of learning. That’s what turns college students into adults, and that is what we all desperately need in the coming years. We should no longer be living with people who have lived just like us, who are our age and who think the way we do. A necessary next step is a period of uncomfortable intellectual wandering before we find our new normals. For that, we have to rely on our own syllabi.
Yale College Council elections are happening now, and I hope that you plan to vote if you haven’t already.
Even before I began my term as dean, YCC had long worked toward enacting two major initiatives that went into effect this year: the domestic summer award and the extension of the Credit/D/Fail deadline. Major initiatives like these require substantial engagement with the community, and neither of these would have been possible without the Yale College Council, serving as your elected representatives.
I meet with YCC leadership at least monthly to discuss ways to improve life at Yale both inside and outside of the classroom. I rely on YCC’s excellent policy reports, which are supported with research and data, both empirical and anecdotal, and which rely heavily on input from you. YCC recommendations provide focus, which in turn allows the University to propose focused solutions.
I have questions of my own for the year ahead: How can the YCC and I enhance the residential colleges? The shopping period? The meal plan? How can we expand opportunities for campus work and research? How can we promote balance, wellness and safety? What kind of support — or independence — can we give student organizations?
Now it’s your turn. In order to tell me what’s on your mind, get involved in the elections in progress, choose your representatives and engage with them. This year’s leaders — Matt Guido, Nick Girard, Devyn Rigsby and many others — have been exceptional colleagues. I am eager to work with the next ones you elect into office. If you are a student in Yale College and haven’t voted yet in the YCC elections, please vote now.

From April 13 to April 20, the Yale Communication and Consent Educators, the Women’s Center and Unite Against Sexual Assault at Yale will co-host the annual Take Back the Night week. It is an international, weeklong movement with the goal of fighting against sexual misconduct on campus. Since its creation in 1975, college students around the world have held Take Back the Night to unite and to raise awareness of issues sexual disrespect. Early college Take Back the Night events featured marches through city streets surrounding university campuses, Yale organizers have since moved away from imagining sexual assault solely as a phenomenon in dark alleyways off campus. Realizing the way these images perpetuate racialized threats divorced from the realities of sexual assault, Yale Take Back the Night instead focuses on creating spaces for survivors to share stories and to create a change in campus culture. In this post #MeToo moment, Take Back the Night takes on new meaning as we all grapple with the movement’s implications.
More than ever, we, the Yale community, have a responsibility to care for one another and to engage in these conversations about sexual assault on our campus. We know how pervasive sexual disrespect is. We know it touches communities around the world and within our campus. We know that it too often goes unacknowledged. But as #MeToo has grown into campuswide and nationwide conversations, we have also seen what it looks like when we demand better. Building on the legacy of advocates and organizers from across the country, survivors and their allies on this campus have imagined a new reality. They’ve shown us what it looks like to support people who have experienced sexual violence, to create spaces for sharing experiences and to advocate for change. Through their advocacy, they challenge us to create a new Yale — one where sexual disrespect of all forms is taken seriously and where sexual respect and accountability are the norm.
Throughout the week there will be a variety of events, ranging from yoga classes, chalking on Cross Campus and writing letters to incarcerated women to a brunch at the Women’s Center. The diversity of events recognizes that there is no one way to share, to reflect or to show support in the wake of sexual disrespect and assault. Take Back the Night invites all Yalies to join in the events. Tomorrow, the Speak Out, which is the traditional centerpiece of Take Back the Night, will take place on Cross Campus. At 1 p.m., students from across campus will tell stories about a range of sexual and romantic experiences — both their own and those submitted anonymously. They’ll share poems and sing songs of empowerment, and it will be a space not only for vulnerability, isolation and violation but also of support, acceptance and mutual recognition.
Many others will come just to listen. And these quiet shows of recognition and support are just as important to shift our campus culture. To push our dialogue around sexual disrespect beyond the typical victim tropes and recognize those who have been looked over, we must create spaces where all survivors feel comfortable. A successful Take Back the Night must be intersectional; it must recognize that sexual disrespect often falls along lines of power, privilege and marginalization. This week is for giving all people who have experienced sexual violence a space to speak, to share and to reflect. It’s as much for those who have spent their Yale careers speaking out about sexual assault as it is for those who have never had a platform to do so. It’s about a diversity of experiences and a diversity of backgrounds. Ultimately, Take Back the Night challenges us to create stronger communities for the survivors around us.
Just as there is no one kind of survivor, there is no one way to Take Back the Night. Come to speak and come to listen. Come to write messages of love and support on the sidewalk, to give hugs and to hold hands — to run, to brunch and to dance. Together, we can create spaces for all survivors on our campus and show solidarity for all experiences.
If you had any lingering doubts about the state of America’s culture industry, they should have been violently laid to rest by Elizabeth Eden Harris, whose recent interview with the News contained almost as much smut and swearing as do her songs. Since being invited to perform at Spring Fling back in February, Harris — less flatteringly known as “Cupcakke” — has become the subject of countless encomia and appreciations, mostly from the progressive left. One student gushed that, “by being open about her sexuality, [Cupcakke] normalizes it in a way that is both unique, refreshing and inspiring.” Another defended Cupcakke on the grounds that she “does not negatively target any demographics or groups.” Having cleared this loftiest of bars, the Chicago-born rapper is ready to take Old Campus by a storm, and in her words, “make everyone scream, ‘Suck dick.’”
Needless to say, Cupcakke apologists have their work cut out for them. Every argument advanced on her behalf has proven comically specious and easily rebuttable: That something is not always wrong does not mean it should be normalized; violent, tonsil-ripping sex probably has the same moral valence as euthanasia, OK under certain conditions but quite dubious under others. That something is “subversive” does not mean it will be perceived as such; I highly doubt that inebriated 20-year-olds are going to hear Cupcakke’s lyrics and think “bell hooks!”
As for the claim that Yale students know better than to make harmful generalizations about women’s carnal preferences on the basis of one isolated example — really? So people can magically separate groups from individuals when it comes to kinks and fetishes but not when it comes to affirmative action, genetic differences or the Google Memo? Yup. Makes sense, guys.
Of course, the poo-pooing of Cupcakke from conservatives evinces several contradictions of its own. True, songs like “Deepthroat” and “Vagina” aren’t exactly textbooks on how to treat a lady, but neither are ASAP Ferg’s paeans to coke-fueled orgies or Eminem’s glorifications of domestic abuse. If your argument is that violent, objectifying lyrics cause violence and objectification, singling out Cupcakke specifically does betray something of a double standard, one less divorced from race and gender than her detractors might like to think.
But what Cupcakke lacks in cruelty, she makes up for in vulgarity. The thing that most distinguishes her from other artists — the thing that makes her so shockingly offensive — is the way she transgresses norms and boundaries and other signifiers of distinction until everything is reduced to the same pitiable equality, the same plane of value. This probably explains the discomfort many people feel at Cupcakke’s enjoinder to, among other things, “Nut in my pussy hair”: It demystifies what should be mysterious, makes ugly what should be beautiful and, in doing so, it sterilizes intimacy.
That sterilization — if you can call such lyrics “sterile” — has been well-received by critics and connoisseurs from Yale all the way to The New Yorker, no doubt because it accords with our culture’s transactionalized view of sex — indeed, of human interaction writ large. Here then is one hypothesis for why moralists tend to focus more on Cupcakke’s violence than her crudeness: We have become so anesthetized to vulgarity — and vulgarians — that we lack the vocabulary to articulate what’s wrong with it. High and low, beautiful and base, worthy and unworthy — such distinctions cannot be made once distinction itself becomes taboo. Cupcakke thus embodies the democratic sentiments of her age, which grants her a certain sort of impunity; it’s hard for us democrats to criticize democracy, even one as depraved as our own.
I know, I know: What about free speech, artistic liberty, thinking the unthinkable and all the rest? Anyone making those arguments would do well to consider how vulgarity enhances self-expression in the first place. Deployed strategically, coarse language can challenge taboos and slaughter sacred cows; it can also serve as a point of emphasis, a declaration that something is important enough to be worth violating convention.
But for it to do that, there must be some conventions to violate — otherwise transgression loses its meaning, nay, its very possibility. When artists like Cupcakke normalize smut and sin and skin-flick sighs, they inevitably act as parasites, draining our culture of the strictures and shalt-nots which allow norm-breaking to matter. Cross the proverbial line too often, and eventually there will be no line left to cross, no avenue to shock, startle and offend. Far from promoting free expression, excess vulgarity corrodes the standards on which much of that expression — particularly the outrageous parts — depends. Sooner or later some restraint, some decency, must be imposed for cultural dynamism to flourish — for sex and swearing to move us and for rebels and renegades to find purposive rebellion.
So to those excited for Spring Fling’s trenchant social commentary, I have only this to say: Give me a f—ing break.
At the end of my first year, I ran for Berkeley College representative because Sydney Wade, then chief of staff, reached out to our Black Women’s GroupMe,  pointed out that she was the only black woman on council that year and encouraged more black women to run. This is what inspired me then to apply for the executive board position of student outreach coordinator and now to run for president.
I am running for president in part because a student council should always be descriptive of the student body and that is made very difficult when not all groups in the student body are represented. This allows for more productive and informative conversations to occur, and that’s when real change can happen. Being a part of Yale College Council this past year has given me experiences I never would have gotten otherwise. As student outreach coordinator, I’ve had the opportunity to speak with student groups and student leaders across campus. I’ve had the opportunity to speak with administrators who seemed unreachable before. I am now running for president because I believe we can form coalitions of student groups on campus to push for the changes we want in the administration.
Along with the task of making the council more diverse, I also want to expand our outreach into New Haven. Through the creation of YCC field trips, partnered with other student groups, Yale students have the opportunity to volunteer with an organization within the New Haven community. These trips can allow students to create bonds with organizations and return later.
My vision to help put students first is to strengthen the relationship between YCC and other student organizations. YCC has relationships with administrators and creates real change on campus — but it doesn’t mean much if students don’t recognize that. With the creation of YCC newsletters, the student body can be updated at every step of the way. This newsletter would create a space for students to see just where YCC is in the semester and serve as an opportunity to hold us accountable. It would also feature 2–3 student organizations, who they are and what they do on campus. We would invite them to council to update us on their activities so that all of council can be informed, because campus organizations are one of the ways students currently try to communicate with the administration.  Making the YCC into a platform for those groups to interact with the administration would help amplify all of our voices.
Along with structural and internal YCC change, I would also advocate strongly for changes that the student body wishes to see, focusing primarily on financial aid reform and mental health. As a low-income student, financial aid has been a concern of mine since getting into Yale. I am lucky that a majority of my aid comes from outside scholarships, but other students are not so fortunate. Your Yale experience should not be based on your income level and I would advocate for real financial aid reform to be seen. Speaking with administrators regarding financial aid policies, informing them of student concerns and helping to make the process easier to understand is a goal of mine.
Mental health reform is also important to me because Yale is a very stressful place, and considering that most people get diagnosed with a mental illness in college, better structures should be in place to help students who do go through these challenges. These structures should be created both by the administration and student groups. There are already student groups working around mental health at Yale and YCC can aid them in any way they need, as well as crafting our own ways to help. Diversity of Yale Health therapists, as well as shorter wait times to see therapists, are on my list as ways to improve the mental health of students.
Working with Matt Guido ’19, Nick Girard ’19 and Devyn Rigsby ’19, as well as the other amazing members of council and the executive board, has been a highlight of my year. As student outreach coordinator, I’ve gained skills that I will be able to take with me for the rest of my life and into the presidency. Having only one year of experience within YCC does not hinder me — it is advantageous. I have no preconceived notions of what YCC needs to be and can therefore bring about the revolutionary change that is needed. Before joining, I heard concerning things about YCC, but luckily this wasn’t my experience. Now it’s time the whole student body know too.
YCC has the potential to be an amazing organization for all students. If we work together, current and future generations of Yale students can have a better Yale. If we make the YCC an even better representative of our voices, we can truly put students first.
The Yale College Council has made enormous strides this year in areas ranging from the creation of the Domestic Summer Award to Credit/D/Fail policy reform, impacting the lives of nearly every Yale undergraduate along the way. I’m proud to say that I had a hand in these policies and even led the charge on a few.
I’d like to commend Matt Guido ’19 for his outstanding leadership of the council over the last year. However, next year’s YCC president needs to think even bigger — building on the momentum and goodwill accumulated through the course of this year, the YCC shouldn’t be afraid to tackle more formidable issues, like dining hall hours, funding for student projects across all disciplines and mental health care reform.
Only someone who has been in the field working to solve these problems can offer a credible agenda and plan of action for tackling these issues. Without relevant experience, a candidate’s promises are speculative at best and misleading at worst — a president with extensive experience will have already had the right conversations with the right people while the inexperienced officer is still figuring out where to start. The YCC serves two critical roles on campus: policymaking and event planning. The council of representatives constitutes the policymaking side, while the events committee, Spring Fling Committee and the class councils comprise the events site of YCC. The YCC president needs to be well-versed in both of these aspects in order to effectively lead the entire organization.
From serving for a year on the council of representatives on the science, technology, engineering and math student advisory committee, and pushing for the creation of the Domestic Summer Award, I know how to get the right policies in front of the right people at the right time. After serving as First-Year Class Council president, Sophomore Class Council vice president and a two-year member of the YCC events committee, I’ve put in countless hours of work to plan events ranging from alumni networking events all the way to thousand-student study breaks.
I believe I’m the candidate best equipped to leverage these successes into even more impactful policies. From my experience working with Yale Dining to pull off multiple special events, I have the credibility to actually deliver on reallocating dining hall hours. I’ve spent hours working with and getting to know Yale’s administrators to create the Domestic Summer Award to fund nonprofit projects — I know the right people to talk to secure a printing stipend for students on financial aid. I’ve listened to the concerns of countless student groups and connected them with the resources to pull off the events they want — I have a plan in place to link student organizations, New Haven businesses and the YCC to produce even more events in the future. For more details about my policies, please visit my website.
However, all this progress will be irrelevant if YCC fails to communicate with the outside world. Many students are unaware of who their representatives are or of the policies in focus that year. This has resulted in a negative perception of YCC as an out-of-touch organization that spends an inordinate amount of time on minor policies. As president, I will insist on greater communication with the general student body through emails, website updates and representative outreach.
Amidst the whirlwind of campaigning, flyering and postering happening on campus this week, I want to be very clear: This is all for you. Yale College Council is an organization of service, and I would be honored and humbled to carry on this proud tradition at its helm. I want to listen to your thoughts and act as an instrument for you and your organization to enact the changes you want to see at scale.
And scale is the name of the game — the YCC will be shooting itself in the foot if it forsakes the momentum accumulated over the last year. My track record, connections and know-how uniquely position me as the only candidate who will realistically be able to take advantage of this momentum and serve you at the highest level.
Because of this, the coming year — more than any other — will be a crossroads for Yale’s undergraduates. Let’s work together to make this the year that Yale finally enacts substantive mental health reform, the year that dining halls are finally open when we need them to be, the year that organizations on and around campus are finally held accountable for fostering a positive sexual climate.  I hope you’ll join me in tackling these big issues and more, once and for all.
Remy Dhingra ’20 and I did not come to Yale thinking we would join the Yale College Council. It never crossed my mind until my friend convinced me to attend a YCC meeting. I had always envisioned the YCC to be a place of activism: somewhere opinions could be heard, plans could be made and actions could be taken. But when I suggested an idea to someone on the council, they suggested I submit a question for the YCC’s spring survey. The YCC has become a glorified pollster, and we entered this race because Yale students deserve a better college council.
Right now, the YCC spends most of its time compiling surveys and reports. Try searching “YCC report” — you’ll find the ten pages of headlines or the 57 reports the YCC lists on its website. The primary product of the YCC is words, not action.
This is because students usually run on a laundry list of ideas that range from “improving transparency of the Yale Corporation” or “improving the social scene at Yale.” In fact, we’ve looked through YCC promises from the past five years and estimate that about 95 percent of those promises were never fulfilled. It’s not a surprise when these ideas don’t make it past the report phase and aren’t actually accomplished.
However, under a few focused efforts, the YCC has been able to improve student life. For example, in 2012, the YCC published their “Salad @ Yale” report. Following student feedback and an audit of the salad bars in the dining hall, the YCC lobbied on behalf of five reforms, including better salad dressings. It took less than two months for Yale Dining to adopt these reforms.
While this whole process was a bit silly, it shows that much of the YCC’s problems are not in its infrastructure but rather its motivations. Remy and I got into this race because we believe that students who are motivated — not enveloped — in the YCC’s inaction can push it to do better.
We’re running on three actionable and deliverable ideas we firmly believe we can accomplish in our first 90 days: adding mental health emergencies as a reason for dean’s excuses, semester allowances for free printing, improving dining hall coffee. These are all specific ideas that the YCC actually has the purview to work on and suggestions you can hold us accountable to.
That’s not to say that the current structure of the YCC is perfect. Its flagship achievement this year — extending the Credit/D/Fail deadline 90 days — was actually an initiative started in 2007. Any organization that takes over eleven years to complete a small and bureaucratic change is operating inefficiently. Remy and I have a concrete plan to overhaul the YCC. We’ll break down the entire structure, reforming it into a senate-based structure, and also livestream all meetings. Additionally, we’re advocating reform to the YCC constitution to schedule a referendum on the president’s and vice president’s performance in the fall and make recall elections actually possible.
No other candidate for YCC president this year has a concrete plan to reduce and abolish the student income contribution. For an issue that so deeply affects so many students, we are appalled that candidates didn’t take the time to establish a plan on this issue. The Yale administration walks all over the student body on this issue, and the Yale College Council doesn’t seem to mind. That’s cowardly. We will give the Yale administration one month to lay out a plan to wind down the student income contribution. If they don’t, on day 31, we will establish a 501(c)(3) and start a capital campaign to raise the money ourselves. Our goal is to reduce the student income contribution by $500 per student. The Yale administration doesn’t have students’ backs. Someone needs to.
Let’s not fall victim to the same campaign that happens almost every year: a few YCC insiders who toss around huge ideas with no plans to implement them. We don’t need more reports collecting dust on the YCC website, and we don’t want the YCC to serve itself. Are you content to wait a couple more decades for real change on the student income contribution, mental health and something as simple as better coffee? Instead, challenge your candidates to explain exactly how the surveys they’ve sent out have made your life better. Challenge your candidates to explain their plans and ideas. And challenge your candidates to explain how they’ll shake up the YCC, because something is clearly not working.

These past couple of days of campaigning have been filled with exciting conversations. I’ve spoken with Yalies in classes and in cultural centers. I’ve spoken with Yalies at student group meetings and at performances. I’ve spoken with Yalies on street corners and over coffee. I’ve heard so many brilliant ideas about making Yale a better place from so many passionate Yalies. Through these conversations and chats, I asked myself: How can we better use these ideas?
I have been proud to be part of the Yale College Council ever since I got to campus. In the past two years, I have served as an associate representative, as academics director on the YCC executive board and as the chair of the recent YCC sexual climate working group. I have worked on and directed policy projects, piloted programs and advocated for change with the Yale administration. The YCC has, especially in the past year, gotten many things done: the Domestic Summer Award, American Sign Language, the First-Year Handbook, Menstrual Hygiene Programs and Credit/D/Fail reform. But while these reforms were valuable, I know that more can and ought to be done.
I’m running for YCC President because I believe that we can and must improve our YCC. It is our obligation to future Yalies to do so.
In my past two years on council, I’ve seen the YCC function well as an independent policymaking and policy-advocacy body. But the YCC has not functioned as a voice of the students. The YCC doesn’t reflect the diversity of students it aims to advocate for. The YCC is not a representative of the Yalies it serves.
The YCC must be improved by revolutionary changes to its structure. My plans for internal YCC reform will, I hope, do just that. I’m proposing a new YCC that would include two student bodies. The first body, the senate, would function as a policymaking and policy-advocacy body, much as the YCC does right now. The second body, the council, would bring together representatives from most student groups on campus, including cultural houses, service organizations, residential college councils, YCC subsidiary bodies and committees and graduate student government. The council would bring together students and student organizations that are representative of all voices on campus and would be a place to discuss relevant campus issues, voice student concerns and hear student ideas. With this comprehensive change, the YCC would become a force of cohesion and unity. The YCC would better represent the diversity of the student body. The YCC would gain the leverage and power to hold administrators accountable and to better advocate for change. It would bring all Yalies together on one connected campus.
Using my running mate Heidi Dong’s ’20 experience as University services director on the executive board and chair of the YCC mental health working group, as well as my own experience, we have worked with dozens of student group leaders to craft a visionary but practical plan, not simply a platform, for what we aim to accomplish in the upcoming year. While the issues that we aim to tackle — sexual and social climate, mental health and wellness and University policy — are tough, we believe that we have the experience to know what is possible and how to get things done. Just because change is difficult, it does not mean that we should give up on it altogether.
I believe in a future YCC that is a true voice of the entire student body and works effectively with the Yale administration on behalf of each and every student. I believe in one connected campus, and I believe in a better Yale experience.
I’m running for this position because I believe that the YCC has the ability to grow into a more diverse, representative, powerful and effective organization. Most importantly, I believe we can use these changes to get more things done and make Yale a better place, both for us and for future students.
A recent News survey suggests that about 93 percent of students are at least “content” with life at Yale. Putting questions of survey methodology aside, most of us can agree to the weaker claim that for a majority of students, life is pretty good, overall. Clearly, Yale’s doing something right.
But the Yale experience is still far from perfect. This year, Yale has seen a record number of sexual misconduct complaints. Wait times to see therapists at Mental Health & Counseling often span weeks, leaving students unassisted in their more vulnerable times. Dining hall hours must expand to meet student demands for more flexible meal schedules. Students cannot currently eat at dining hall after 8 p.m. — if they make the trek up to Morse and Ezra Stiles colleges. In other words, we still have a long way to go. How can the Yale College Council work alongside campus organizations to improve students’ lives?
Take sexual misconduct as an example. Currently, those wishing to report cases of sexual misconduct must do so by either phone or email — neither of which are anonymous, and both of which require extra legwork from the reporting party. (Can you name any Title IX officials?) We need to create an anonymous online system to remove unnecessary barriers to reporting cases of sexual misconduct. And we need to ensure that decision makers in cases of formal complaints come from a wider variety of backgrounds by increasing student representation and advocating for more diversity on the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct.
It is unfair that many students miss meals because of their busy schedules and inflexible dining hours, and that student athletes can barely return from practice on time to make it to dinner. Luckily, administration is open to working with us to address this issue. Here’s the thing: We’re trying to avoid raising the costs of the meal plan even higher than they already are. I’m proposing a pilot plan where we stagger the dinner hours of a pair of colleges — for example, Berkeley would be open from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., Hopper from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., and they would rotate each semester. This will lead to minimal, if any, increases in labor costs.
Wait times at Mental Health & Counseling are still far too long. The most obvious solution is to simply push for more clinicians. But from the University’s point of view, it already has a low student-to-clinician ratio compared to peer institutions, and it is hiring four additional clinicians next year. While we should continue to advocate for more, we need to think of other ways to decrease wait times. That’s why YCC should actively work with the administration and wellness groups to create a wellness center that will support students facing less serious mental health problems. This will decrease wait times at Mental Health & Counseling, provide interim support for students who face the longest wait times and encourage students who are hesitant to reach out about their problems to seek out help.
For any long-term or short-term change to be enacted, the administration needs to see plans that are concrete, feasible and impactful. I argue that my policies are all three. Most importantly, they reflect discussions I’ve had with students coming from a wide range of backgrounds over the past two years. A nonrepresentative student government has no legitimacy in the eyes of students or administration, and we need non-YCC students to be actively engaged in realizing our common goals.
To achieve this, YCC needs a president who has experience outside of the council. My dedication to strengthening ties between the YCC and cultural organizations stems from my heavy involvement in both, as I’ve served as an intercultural liaison in the Asian American Students Alliance and as a co-moderator of the Taiwanese American Society. I am also a member of the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct, which offers me valuable insight into formal proceedings relating to sexual assault cases on campus. And as you all know from all the times you’ve seen “Shunhe Wang added a photo in Yale Memes for Special Snowflake Teens,” I’m willing to put myself out there for you guys.
YCC also needs a president who knows how student government and administration function. Effective external policies originate in efficient internal mechanisms. I have served on Morse College Council for two years and was the Morse representative to the YCC this year. As a representative, I worked toward improving pre-law resources and contributed to the continuation of the Yale Society Initiative, and as a member of the constitution and elections working group, I proposed constitutional changes to be debated later this month. I am keenly aware of YCC’s faults, and I believe I can make effective reforms because I care deeply about improving YCC and improving Yale. But I can’t do it by myself. Both I and the YCC need you, too. Let’s make you, the reason the YCC exists, a part of the change.
With 30 glorious libraries, over 15 million items, a nave that attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year and reading rooms that have animated some of the greatest minds in history, the Yale University library system is indisputably an inspiration to us all.
Now contrast this splendor with another image: dark, uncomfortable, individual study carrels with no books in sight.
This could be the future of libraries as described in a recent report on student usage of Bass Library. The report was commissioned by the University to find study locations to accommodate the expansion of Yale College. A previous column (SCHICK: “The books in Bass,” Nov. 6, 2017) gave an excellent overview of the problems associated with a possible renovation prior to the report’s release. However, it is worth revisiting the broader implications in light of new information.
The renovation follows a pernicious trend across the University. Administrators frequently make drastic changes to Yale’s operations according to short-term survey reports, often affected by user bias, that generally seek solutions outside of pre-existing infrastructures. The result: a seemingly endless cycle of expansions, new problems and Band-Aid solutions.
Current plans to renovate Bass reflect Yale’s “patch-up” approach to major trend shifts among student populations — renovate and add instead of repurpose and maintain. But in some ways, the library renovations are indicative of an even more depressing pattern. Librarians today across the world often tout digitization and observance of modern technology trends as a boon; in doing so, however, they prove that they fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of a library. The library should always act as a preserver of knowledge, standing against the fierce onslaught of modernity and giving every patron a space to look thoughtfully and slowly at the world around them. The library should not offer an escape from humanity but an introduction to and deeper understanding about everything it entails.
The Bass renovation, if it prioritizes the removal of books and the addition of individual study carrels, detracts from any positive vision of a library. The report offers some ideas about steering undergraduates back toward the shelves, sadly noting that “many respondents had not touched a book in years,” but the focus was on tenuous data collected to study space allocation.
On-site interviews were only conducted with five undergraduates, with the majority of numbers coming from spontaneous observations as recorded by a contracted design anthropologist from outside of Yale.
Yet, even with a supposed focus on student accommodation, the report ignores several obvious changes that could be enacted without any major disruptions. Peer into the two bottom floor computer labs of Bass, and you’ll see keyboards pushed to the edge of the desks with the computers largely untouched. The rooms should each be turned into several new study spaces, a mix of the reserve and walk-in variety.
Other spaces could also ease the burden off of Bass. The Center for Teaching and Learning already offers several open study rooms, but even more offices could be devoted to the cause. Near Bass, William L. Harkness Hall has a host of empty classrooms where students can study at night. The new colleges, with a significant amount of empty space, could also offer more rooms devoted to late night study.
The report is further wrong to assume that students’ lack of interest in books is a reason to relocate them. Librarians should instead ask, How do we convince students to love the library again? Far too much effort is wasted on digitization instead of thinking creatively about how to reinvigorate a book culture. The report tries to connect the two concepts as a way of bringing students closer to what it calls “physical items,” but the library should also encourage students to approach the library as a library.
One way Bass can do this is to curate its collections from the Library Shelving Facility and Sterling Memorial Library to reflect classroom book demand. Students frequently make the claim that professors should offer more PDF readings to ease the cost of class materials. Librarians could hold physical copies of class syllabi, with instructions indicating how to find available texts. The current Bass class reserve system is also flawed — rather than automatically place seven copies of the same book on 24-hour reserve, for example, one or two should be held permanently for in-library use, and the rest should circulate freely.
I don’t mean to denigrate the efforts of Yale librarians — they are simply responding to a crisis that began with a severe lack of foresight by upper level administrators. To its credit, the report does detail several helpful approaches to reviving undergraduate library culture at Yale. But the future of libraries shouldn’t be tied to the attention spans of its young, laptop-wielding dwellers and shouldn’t depend on outside ethnographic studies to understand what the library fundamentally means to Yale. If you’re unsure, take a stroll to the southwest corner of the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library to see the 1742 Yale library catalogue. That’s where this glorious university started, with just a collection of books.

Earlier this week, I was informed that my high school had resolved to cancel all advanced Latin courses starting next year. Apart from the grim irony of receiving this news while visiting classics graduate programs, I dreaded the blow that this decision would deal to the already declining study of the humanities. With that, my school had joined the ranks of many others across the nation that have been pressured to cut Latin and other foreign language or arts electives, citing budget and hiring issues.
Latin may be considered dead, but such modern-day attacks have threatened to render it truly obsolete.
The disappearance of Latin instruction from my high school is all the more regrettable for the brief but robust period of flourishing it enjoyed under the hands of the late Maureen O’Donnell. A gifted secondary school Latin instructor whose dynamic personality and outstanding success attracted national attention, O’Donnell left an incredible legacy of devotion both to the study of Latin and, more importantly, to cultivating a sense of personal honor in her students. In 1982, she became the first high school teacher to receive an honorary doctorate from Yale for her “tireless brilliance and devotion to [her] language and [her] profession.” These qualities are faithfully confirmed by the testimonies and eulogies of her former students, for whom she was “mater et magistra.”
When I attended high school, the last vestiges of the program that O’Donnell had undertaken so tirelessly to build from the ground up were already rapidly waning. The exceptionalism of her work casts into painfully sharp relief the banal passivity of its end, the depressingly common process of abandonment through which so many Latin programs falter and fail. The death of Latin at my high school was a long time coming, thanks to an increasingly frayed relationship between negligent administrators and overburdened teachers, combined with a growing national apathy toward the humanities. Last January, the news that Virginia Republicans were advancing a bill to replace modern language requirements with computer coding perhaps only presaged this new development in the decline of Latin in secondary schools, which in turn will choke the stream of students who go on to study the classics in college.
Strangely, it was in the supposedly arcane and niche environment of the Latin classroom that I have found some of the best models for thoughtful and accessible pedagogy. My high school served students with special needs, several of whom were enrolled in advanced Latin. One of my most brilliant classmates was deaf and mute, but participated fully by way of an interpreter in the room. Her enthusiasm for Latin was warmly accommodated by my teacher, who herself was sensitive to individual needs and difficulties with learning Latin. The class was so well integrated that it is only now, four years later and after a Yale-granted education in identity politics, that I now fully recognize this situation as unusual — certainly for the classics. Maureen O’Donnell’s students, too — who at one point numbered over 250 in total, including, famously, the entire swim team — were remarkable for the passion they shared despite their disparate and unlikely identities.
Here at Yale — where Maureen O’Donnell was honored for her success 36 years ago — I can only watch helplessly as all the heart and soul of her work, a shining example of what the study of the classics can mean to young people, are stripped from her former school. I think of my teenage love for elegiac poetry and of the teachers who encouraged me unfailingly to pursue the classics in college and beyond. I think about how my younger sister will never be taught to read Latin literature in a high school classroom.
Yet even at an elite private university like Yale, which is supposed to be a dedicated haven for the humanities, the classics are not spared the challenges of the dysfunctional relationship between the university and the classroom. The Classics department and its faculty have long protested alleged administrative misappropriations of its endowed funds, which are meant to be used for travel grants and other student enrichment opportunities, toward renovations. More broadly, Yale has neglected hiring in a number of departments in the humanities, instead prioritizing the greener pastures of STEM initiatives.
As Latin programs are cut from secondary schools across the nation, I pray that Yale will not follow the same path. As a future alumna, I hope that future generations of students will have the opportunity to enjoy and appreciate the same department and intellectual community that have nourished me, and for which Yale has, in my eyes, truly earned the status of “alma mater.”
Yale, we need to talk. We need to talk about mental health, because we’re not talking enough about it. Why is it easier to cancel dinner plans with a friend by saying, “I’m feeling really sick with a cold, so I don’t think I can make it,” than it is to say, “I’m actually feeling really depressed, so I don’t think I can make it”? Why is it that, even when we’re feeling overwhelmed balancing academic, extracurricular and social obligations, the default response to “How’s it going?” is “OK,” “fine” or “great”? Why is it so hard to talk openly and honestly about our own mental health? There are a lot of reasons, but stigma is a big one. It’s still not completely OK to say that you’re not “OK.” This inability to be vulnerable with one another is hurting us. These conversations are important for knowing when our friends and loved ones are going through tough times and are the best way to make sure they feel supported.
What can we do about this? How do we overcome this stigma? In the end, it comes down to changing people’s attitudes about mental health, a front where important work is already being done. Our dedicated peers are already trying to raise awareness and improve the campus climate surrounding mental health by running panels with student speakers, spearheading social media campaigns and creating undergraduate publications like the Yale Layer. However, something important is missing. Although panels and articles help us learn about our peers’ experiences, encourage us to reflect and make us more open to talking about mental health, they don’t necessarily provide the space for students to have those conversations. That’s why the one thing we really need — the one thing that could have a huge impact on reducing stigma — is a first-year mental health workshop.
When you look at the initiatives for other aspects of student health, a workshop makes perfect sense. During Camp Yale, all first years go to two workshops: the health and sexuality workshops run by the Community Health Educators and the “Myth of Miscommunication” workshops run by the Communication and Consent Educators. If there is already training for sexual health and consent, then why not mental health? An hourlong workshop would provide first years with a safe, moderated environment to talk about the stresses that many students face when adjusting to college life. In an ideal world, first years would walk out of these workshops a bit more convinced that it’s OK to be vulnerable and have open conversations.
A mental health workshop would also provide an opportunity for students to learn about campus resources that are less well known than Yale Health’s Mental Health and Counseling department. Imagine a first year sitting alone in their room at 2 a.m. on a Saturday night, feeling stressed out, homesick and socially isolated but without anyone to talk to about these issues. How can we make sure this first year realizes they can call Walden Peer Counseling, which runs a hotline every night of the school year? Even though that first year may have heard about Walden once or twice during Camp Yale, it’s easy to forget exactly what the service is for or that it runs every night. Alongside Walden, the Chaplain’s Office, cultural houses and Office of LGBTQ Resources provide alternate spaces for students who need to talk about specific issues, even though they are places that people may not traditionally relate to mental health. If first years learn about these resources in a workshop, they will be more likely not only to remember them but also to use them, either for themselves or a friend.
That’s why I founded Mental Health Educators, a new Yale undergraduate organization that is pushing forward a first-year mental health workshop that all incoming first years can attend throughout the 2018–19 academic year. Our hope is to create a future where it’s OK to talk about not being “OK,” and we sincerely believe that our first-year mental health workshop is a step in the right direction. If you’re interested, let’s start talking.
Trying to create change at Yale University is a bit like steering a ship. After the wheel is turned, it takes time for all the parts to move into place so that the vessel can actually change direction. This year, the Yale College Council focused on getting these parts moving and creating change.
The Domestic Summer Award, a $4,000 stipend for undergraduates on financial aid pursuing an unpaid summer internship in public service, has changed the way many students approach the summer internship search. Yale College’s medical emergency policy, which was adopted in 2014 and only included alcohol violations, was expanded to include drug violations in order to better prioritize student safety over discipline. The first American Sign Language classes ever taught in Yale College were unveiled this semester as part of a three-semester pilot program. Beginning next fall, the deadline to register a course Credit/D/Fail will be pushed back until midterm, giving students eight full weeks of classes to decide which ones they wish to elect under the Credit/D/Fail option. Just next week, the YCC will launch a pilot program that provides free menstrual hygiene products in three residential colleges as we recognize that these products are a necessity that places an inequitable financial burden on many students.
The YCC plays a necessary and important role in working with the University administration to improve the student experience. But the YCC is only as effective as the students who compose it and the willingness of students across campus to speak up about the issues that matter the most to them. Our Council of Representatives is composed of more than thirty students who bring their diverse academic, extracurricular and social perspectives into every meeting. We bring conversations over dinner with friends in our residential colleges, late-night debates with our suitemates and discussions from meetings for other student organizations. Our advocacy is derived from the students all around us.
During my time with the YCC, I’ve realized that the work we do is about more than simply understanding what students want. Rather, it’s about helping students and administrators better understand the wants of those around them. Every Yale experience is different and special in its own way. When we realize and embrace that, our community is strengthened and we have more to learn from one another.
Yale can oftentimes seem bureaucratic and decentralized. However, I view this system as an opportunity. It gives each one of us the chance to influence and affect different parts of the University. Chat with your head of college about why you chose to move off-campus. Schedule a meeting with the chair of your academic department to inquire about faculty diversity within the department. Attend town halls, speak outs and other events that allow you to share your experiences with fellow members of the Yale community. There are openings all around us to share our opinions and make our voices heard. We can create positive and lasting change within this system if each one of us starts by sharing their story and trying to better understand the stories of those around them. The YCC is ready to help facilitate these important conversations and help Yale administrators better understand the community they serve.
Yale College is currently trying to answer some important questions about issues core to the Yale experience. How can the residential college system evolve to meet the needs of the modern Yale student? How can we create a safer sexual climate on campus? How can we create an environment that better emphasizes mental wellness? Your input and solutions to these questions have the chance to impact the lives of Yale undergraduates for generations to come.
View the YCC as a vessel through which change can be achieved at Yale. Realize that you are the captain of this ship and the author of this change. Be ready to take the helm.

I hate Google Calendar. I prefer to keep track of my schedule in my head, thank you very much! But, of course, I’m in the vocal minority around here. It both amuses and perplexes me that Yalies schedule so much of our lives. I was ever so slightly miffed the other week when I noticed that a first-year friend of mine had marked the time we hung out on her Google Calendar as a “Coffee Chat.” Though it was almost certainly a joke, it’s a little sad that first years are privy to the language used by consultancies to market their hiring events for undergraduates. But I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised.
Yalies have always been ambitious, and everyone around here is hungry to achieve some nebulous idea of success. Increasingly, students view success as arriving at academic and career milestones before everyone else. This phenomenon manifests itself in many ways: Students now intern earlier than ever, sophomores and juniors usually lead clubs instead of seniors, and of course, many students take courses that previous generations wouldn’t have even seen until graduate school. There’s nothing inherently wrong with this, of course, but we shouldn’t conflate doing things early with doing things well.
Companies seem to feed into this strange obsession with accelerating our life progression. Consider the case of internships I mentioned before. The Goldman Sachs Summer Analyst Internship proudly advertises that its 2019 internship program will open its application on July 1, 2018. That’s almost a year in advance, which is patently absurd. Even worse, as a friend of mine who went through the finance recruiting process informed me last year, many of the analysts hired will probably have networked throughout their sophomore year, if not earlier. The tech industry is no better. First years compete for coveted spots at the likes of Google, Facebook and other large firms. They, too, recruit as early as the previous summer.
So why does this happen? On a campus of child prodigies, folks are used to accomplishing things at a younger age than normal. But we’ve forgotten why prodigies are prodigies. A chess player isn’t just brilliant because she started playing at the age of three; it’s because she was also really good. And yet, it seems that students don’t assess success by how well we perform, but by the credentials we collect. Quite frankly, students don’t really know all that much as first years and sophomores. Yalies at Google and Apple who just took their first computer science classes are unlikely to be even half as effective as their counterparts who have a few more years of coursework under their belts. Besides, a culture of interning early incentivizes mastering interviews — not mastering material.
Nowadays, the accelerated timeline pressures students to build up a stellar resume even before junior year. If you don’t think about it too hard, this seems like a win-win: When students intern earlier, they can experience more organizations and form better opinions about their preferences. Similarly, these organizations get a better sense of whom they’re buying, so to speak.
But what this means is that from the get-go Yalies can’t relax. First years shouldn’t worry about their careers so soon and, student should remember that taking a summer off is not a death sentence for anyone’s career. And yet, anxiety about falling behind on the Yale internship timeline remains one of the main worries I hear from first years. College is our last chance to be kids, and you probably don’t need more than a summer to get a sense of whether you enjoy working in a particular field. Why surrender, as so many students do, the chance to have fun in an environment with relatively few responsibilities in favor of a perpetual job hunt?
And this is where Google Calendar comes in. The pressure to be so busy that a calendar is necessary probably stems from this very job hunt. It’s the same pressure that causes students to believe that they maximize their chances of getting into a top college by signing up for a million clubs they don’t like in high school. Both pressures are stupid. Whatever you do, just do it well. And here’s a thought: Waste a summer. Especially if you’re a first year or sophomore, don’t intern. Instead, do something spontaneous. A friend of mine spent a month in a monastery in China, for example. Another took a road trip across the country. Yale does, in fact, have resources outside of the Office of Career Strategy. Use them. It’s far more satisfying to have an interesting story than to look good at a dinner party.

What people don’t warn you about senior year is the number of times you will be unexpectedly asked to reveal your biggest hopes and regrets over casual dining hall dinners — especially with the end of the semester just around the corner and commencement under two months away.
“What’s on your Yale Bucket list? What do you wish you had done more during your time here?”
As the sky opens up and colorful signs of spring start to appear, I find myself pondering them as I stroll along the still-dreary New Haven streets.
“If you could go back and give your first-year self some advice, what would you say?”
Well, what would you say?
As I believe my fellow 2018ers would agree, that’s quite a loaded question. Heck, even you first years probably have accumulated enough of the Yale Experience to realize that there isn’t a simple way to encapsulate the wisdom that the act of learning how to thrive, or merely survive, in this place has bestowed upon all of us.
But if my washed-up senior self were to give it a try, my answer would be this:
I wish I had been softer — And I wish you would be too.
No, not the artfully curated, artificially soulful Softboy™ kind of soft. I’m talking about the more literal kind: soft as in supple, malleable and — dare I say it — vulnerable?
Ours seems to be a community that prides itself on our ability to be just about the opposite of soft. Strong-willed. Sculptured bodies. Gritty determination. Tough enough to pull an all-nighter for that midterm paper. And — most of the time — there’s nothing wrong with that. We’re all fighters over here.
But still, when I think back to my time at Yale, this peculiar place where all of us shuffle around trying to bridge the elusive gaps between the people we are and the people we hope to be, the moments that sparkled in my four years’ worth of memory are the ones that are full to the brim with softness.
It’s those late December nights where the entire suite is sprawled out on the common room floor commiserating on the miserable winter and the looming finals. The post-screw migrations where you carried your friends back to their rooms — or was it the other way around? — while making sure no one has lost anything more than a bit of mental clarity and personal dignity. It’s those weekend brunches when you overshared your questionable decisions from the previous night while pleading your roommate for the same wise words she gave you last week. The times you “impulsively” sent that long paragraph of text to a certain someone at 1 a.m. while pretending you didn’t spend the entire day crafting it in your Notes app and have it proofread by a friend or two. It’s those times you went for a walk for some fresh air after giving your mom a call and allowing yourself to cry for the first time in months.
You know what I’m talking about. Those moments when you let your guard down, voluntarily or not, and feel like you are navigating the world heart-first.
Aren’t they some of the most special moments in your Yale too?
Most of us know what these moments are and why they are special. But somehow, between our classes and extracurricular commitments and bi-monthly quarter-life crises, we don’t allow ourselves to soften enough to create and experience them as much as we could.
Beyond just the way we feel, the notion of softness can also be applied to the way we think and our academic and professional pursuits. Being soft means coming into a debate — whether it be the one on Overhead at Yale or during section for your humanities credits — with an intellectual stance that’s firm but not inflexible. It means embracing the reality that in a campus full of brilliant, hard-working ex-valedictorians, sometimes your most-calculated and dedicated efforts might still fall short of the coveted A — or A-, depending on where you fall on the Rhodes Scholar-to-Woads Scholar scale.
Let’s break down the notion that being soft and being strong — emotionally, socially or intellectually — are mutually exclusive. Let’s stop pretending that it’s unnatural to not be on-top-of-it all the time, or that ghosting someone and unsuccessfully avoiding them for the rest of the year requires less effort than having one respectful conversation with a bit of closure. Let’s start acknowledging the fact that we are all more than the hardened-shelled, animated manifestations of our Tinder and LinkedIn profiles, and that we all could afford to be a little more honest and raw.
With the unfolding lightness of this spring season, let’s allow ourselves to bend so that we don’t break.

Around this time last year, whispers of admission and rejection floated through the halls of my private school. It wasn’t long before one of my classmates divulged to several others the true reason I got into Yale. According to her careful calculations, it was because I’m half Mexican.
For people of color, this accusation is common. Attributions of success to race are a dime a dozen. Nonetheless, the comment left me wondering how my half-Mexican and half-Chinese heritage interacted with hundreds of other criteria in the mysterious chemical reaction of college admissions. If you follow any media coverage on affirmative action, these two ethnicities that make up my biracial self, Mexican and Chinese, mean very different things for someone’s supposed advantage — or disadvantage — in college admissions. But it is precisely because my genetic makeup complicates this binary story that I question it.
This isn’t a soapbox for affirmative action. My reflections started with race, but I quickly realized that there are many ways in which we numbly quantify our lives as privilege or hardship. After someone questioned my admission, the pride I once felt flipped into shame. And although my friends insisted that I should feel proud, pride didn’t feel like the right answer anymore either. Shame and pride were mirror images, easy answers to the same question I was constantly considering.
Do I deserve this?
The 2,229 admitted students in the class of 2022 may be wondering something similar. And while I hope no one ever makes you feel ashamed of your admission — regardless of race, legacy or athletic commitments — I also hope that pride is not your primary emotional response to that sought-after congratulatory letter from Jeremiah Quinlan. Shame and pride are two sides of the same coin, and both distort the reality of Yale admission.
Let me be clear: I am not trying to rob anyone of her happiness about completing the college admissions process and perhaps overcoming huge odds to do it. Just the opposite, actually — I think excessive pride bars us from feeling true joy.
For most people, a little pride appears benign, but it can open the door to all kinds of elite syndromes: contempt, superiority, shallow empathy. Of course, it doesn’t happen by itself. With every family friend who fawns over your SAT scores, every stranger who gets googly-eyed over the “Y” on your hat, it becomes a little harder to deflect the compliments and a little easier to believe that you must, in some way, be better than them — and so you deserve more.
The email from Quinlan says, “You have every reason to feel proud.” Maybe. But I think there is far more reason to feel gratitude, awe and a sense of responsibility. It took a village to send me to college. We each represent a constellation of involvement: parents, teachers and baristas who invested their money, time and expertise. When we sidestep gratitude for pride, we trick ourselves into believing that we got ourselves here.
And why not feel awe? You need not grow prematurely jaded at Yale — you can maintain a sense of wonder at hearing the carillon bells ringing outside your seminar room or seeing a lamppost flicker on a snow-covered Old Campus scene straight out of Narnia. But, with an ever-plummeting acceptance rate, let’s reserve some awe for the cosmic arbitrariness of it all. That out of all the hardworking, passionate teenagers in the world, you were part of the tiny minority who even had the financial and cultural resources to apply to Yale.
This fact takes us to our responsibility. Quarrels over affirmative action always come down to fairness, a perplexing double standard. We tell ourselves that the admissions process is fair, that talent will always float to the top. But if we were consistent with the bizarre premium we place on fairness, we would care far more about the thousands of high school students who never dared to think they could go to college, whose talent is concealed by the need to take care of younger siblings, work to support their families or cross gang lines to get to school. Our responsibility is to open the door to Yale wider, not just celebrate after we narrowly slide through.
Prefrosh, congratulations. But if you’re predisposed to ask yourself if you deserve to be at Yale, remember that there are dangers in the word “deserve.” “Do I deserve this?” is the wrong question. Why convert your race or any other part of your identity into mere functions of advantage or disadvantage? Yes, you’ve faced headwinds that held you back. Yes, you’ve experienced tailwinds that boosted you forward. But you are more than either.
So, as strangers ooh and ahh, I encourage you to move past the default urge to self-deprecate with shame or puff up with pride. Augustine wrote, “By my swelling pride I was separated from thee, and my bloated cheeks blinded my eyes.”
Don’t be blinded. Awe, gratitude, responsibility — these are responses worth sustaining in a Yale education.
“You’re the best or you f—— suck.”
This classical musician’s saying has been the most influential advice ever given to me, for better or for worse. It holds true at least in the sphere of music; the world really doesn’t need any more unspectacular performers, each struggling to cobble together a sustainable salary.
Even after deciding against music school, this proverb has remained relevant to my life at Yale. As summer plans are finalized and the internship recruiting season for next summer begins, masses of job offers and rejections have been swarming many of us. Sometimes, shiny dream jobs slip through our fingers, particularly if coveted employers only offer a few positions to college students at large. In these circumstances, we must compete to be the best or else we fail — and it might suddenly feel as if we f—— suck.
Achieving success hasn’t always been a zero-sum game. In the K-12 system, extracurricular competitions with second place, third place, honorable mention and consolation prizes abound. Even selective colleges like Yale have to accept thousands of high schoolers, which doesn’t seem too competitive when you think about the sheer number of acceptances.
I mean, it shouldn’t be impossible to slip in as the 2,229th best applicant in a given year, right?
All students should remember that the nature of competition fundamentally changes after high school, bringing with it some subtle but significant consequences. For example, in order to gain admission to Yale Law School last year, one must have been at least the 240th best applicant. Not only that, but the other candidates are 20-somethings who are probably more mature and ambitious than the average 17-year-old who half-heartedly applies to Yale because his mother tells him to.
Moreover, as a fresh graduate, ideal job opportunities from employers that aren’t huge campus recruiters are typically hard to come by without special connections. A Yale degree in and of itself is far from infallible, especially when intangibles like cultural fit or nepotism can complicate the equation. The once-holy grail of getting into college doesn’t seem so difficult in comparison — I didn’t even have to attend any networking sessions or leverage LinkedIn connections.
Of course, the binary mindset of “succeed” or “fail” required by job hunting is a necessary welcome to the real world. And even though this intensity may bring to mind certain fields (read: finance), Wall Street’s recruiting process in particular actually works really, really well: There are sexy elite banks, marginally less elite banks, feeder schools, thousands of available positions, inclusive college major qualifications, even diversity pipeline programs. It’s essentially applying to college all over again, but this time, they pay us the big bucks!
It’s no wonder prestigious firms consistently manage to attract the most promising students, who coasted through school with wide-ranging passions, like flies to a honey jar. Hell, I’m a vocal environmentalist in love with finance. None of this can or should be changed by decrying big bad Wall Street as per usual.
The real problem is that many of us secretly enjoy the smug satisfaction of feeling like we are the best — yet when we take risks, we can’t always live up to expectations, so we most often stick to the safer and more sensible paths trodden by those before us. This isn’t inherently bad, though it partly explains why Yale College isn’t quite renowned for being a startup mecca, which is a central reason why the tech crowd frequently overlooks Yale.
Thus in order to continue being the best, we’re going to have to improve at sucking, too. Other colleges have already caught on; for instance, the inter-university “Resilience Consortium” shares resources to help overachievers cope with setbacks (every single Ivy League school besides Yale is a member). With nearly 40 percent of American students reporting symptoms of depression and 61 percent reporting anxiety last year, per an American College Health Association survey, it is crucial that we examine our perceptions of failure before universities soon must double as mental health wards.
After a last month packed especially full of successes and failures, I’ve been learning that resilience requires a personal resignification of failure, not a myopic exertion of willpower or whatever people complain that millennials lack. Instead, perhaps we should be the ones thanking ourselves for applying — for trying new things, creating new things, believing in new things — when we click on those ominous thank-you emails.
And as I open that next letter, I also remind myself: “You’re the best or you’re still a teenager figuring everything out, which is perfectly fine, because you have a lifetime of exciting possibilities ahead of you before you grow old and jaded and smelly.”
I’d been fishing before. In middle school, I remember going to Galveston’s piers in the late evenings, where people cast out lines with multiple hooks, baited them with efficiency and pulled up strings of wriggling, silver bodies. But this past summer, when I learned how to fly fish, there was something different when I pulled up the line on my first catch, disengaging the slender hook and feathery fly from the roof of the trout’s mouth.
It sounds cliche to recount and is difficult to communicate, but that catch has stayed with me, highlighting my responsibility for the consequences of my actions. At Yale, however, that individual responsibility often seems easily forgotten.
Yalies are incredibly good at identifying problems in the world. We debate passionately about humanitarian crises, about capitalism; we speak urgently about challenges to free speech and the harm of implicit bias, about the need to respect traditional values or marginalized identities. Give us an article, a guest speaker, all of society — and we can find within it some symptoms of a larger epidemic, point to possible sources of the malaise. Yet, very rarely do we consider ourselves to be patient zero. Instead, the change we seek is often exogenous, leaving space to ignore the impacts of individual decisions.
The conversation on climate change proceeds in this way: When President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accords, a slew of posts flooded social media with deep anger and resentment at the decision. Yalies questioned his judgment, wondered at his shortsightedness and generally declared the need for U.S. participation in a global solution. Simultaneously, however, most Yalies waste food and energy on a daily basis. Only a few of those people actively limit the time they spend in the shower, minimize their meat consumption or think twice about ubering for walkable distances, let alone pay to offset their climate footprint. Most concerned Yalies often shove blame and responsibility towards larger institutions, like corporations and governments, even though climate change is perhaps one of the biggest examples of a collective action problem which rests upon the consumption decisions of individuals.
Even when we speak about less tangible problems like freedom of speech and open, engaging conversation, few students make a personal commitment to uphold those tenets in their everyday lives. The same conservatives who decry the social pressure of political correctness frequently treat the speech of people with opposing viewpoints with open disdain or disrespect, failing to lend an open ear to frank discussions about identity and people’s different lived experiences.
This is true on the left as well: The pursuit of “wokeness” lends itself to critiquing and questioning the actions of others. While a critical eye can be productive, it should also be equally applied. The most important part about being “woke” should not be the ability to brew rage around others, but the constant interrogation of oneself — How can you question your own belief systems? In what ways do we think twice about the actions we take, both seen and unseen?
As we learn more at Yale, our ability to identify the places where things go wrong only sharpens. And I’m glad that we have opinions on how to fix things. Yet, when it comes to solutions for the big, colorful problems we see, we shouldn’t stop where it becomes inconvenient for us to make change, even if it’s definitely much harder to police ourselves than those around us. In excusing ourselves, we also render ourselves powerless, abstracting from the problem and considering it only solvable via some institution or centralized locus of power to which we delegate our own individual agency.
This past summer, while I held the trout’s slippery body and waited for a friend’s pocket knife, I marveled at the way the fiery red scales of the belly transitioned into the golden-white, black-dotted patterns marking the sides, how they rose and fell quickly in my palms as the fish breathed in shock. In the setting sun, watching the other fish rising in the lake before me, my excitement at the catch plateaued.
I thought about how, for the first time, I was directly taking responsibility for the life I’d consumed, for the irreversible change I alone had made in this environment. It’s something I think about now whenever I choose to consume something, do something: How am I holding myself accountable? How am I responsible for what I observe? While starting with the little things might feel inconsequential, it’s an important first step to check our own egos and recognize the weight of each of our individual decisions.
To peruse the News’ archives is to enter another world. Consider the following quotations:
“It is important to recognize that education is not merely a fair-weather activity!”
“It seemed to me part of the Yale spirit to have people just slipping and sliding along in order to learn or teach.”
“I don’t think anything warrants the cancellation of classes. Semesters are ridiculously short as it is. Every day counts.”
The speakers, in order: University President Peter Salovey, former University Secretary Sheila Wellington EPH ’68 GRD ’68 and English professor Leslie Brisman.
Yale cancelled classes, citing the dangers of an impending snowstorm, on the Wednesday before spring break. By our count, this was the fourth snow-related cancellation of classes in the past three and a half years. Between 1978 and Winter Storm Nemo of 2013, which dumped 40 inches of snow on Hamden, Yale cancelled classes precisely zero times. During this period, thirty-five years in duration, the obstinacy of the Yale administration in the face of snow-related difficulties became an enduring part of the Yale ethos. It came to symbolize the devotion to education and a commitment to a particularly New England form of self-reliance.
Much has changed since then. The campus now whips itself into a state of virtual frenzy at the first sign of snow, and students eagerly await any notice of cancellation; the ineffable sturdiness with which we once conducted ourselves as storms closed down upon New Haven has disappeared.
The influx of Californians to Yale in the past thirty years aside, Yale’s increasing propensity to cancel classes in the face of snow is not a phenomenon entirely of its own making. The erosion of risk tolerance in American culture is a general trend, and visible wherever one cares to look — in stagnant rates of interstate migration, representing an unwillingness to take the kinds of economic risks formerly associated with American dynamism; in the drop in rates of entrepreneurialism in the United States, as measured by the foundation of startups since the late 1970s; and in the virtual disappearance of walking to school among primary school students, a nearly universal activity only a half-century ago.
The forces behind the recent spate of snow closures include the increasing legal-mindedness of the Yale administration, an over-confidence in the infallibility of meteorologists and a moderate decline in the centrality of the classroom to the Yale experience. Prior to the most recent cancellation of classes, for instance, forecasts — on which the administration based their decision — predicted a snowfall of around six inches by the time classes were set to begin. On the day, however, accumulation did not begin in earnest until the early evening. The impression left was one of palpable absurdity: streets empty, void of snow, yet students and administrators alike acting as if we had endured the storm of the century.
Part of this trend has been fueled by technological innovation. There was a time not so long ago when schools were canceled early in the morning, as students eagerly awaited the 6 a.m. radio or television broadcast that would clear their days’ schedules. Beginning with Hurricane Sandy, which caused power outages that forced justifiable week-long cancellations, schools discovered that classes could be canceled well in advance by making use of Honeywell phone systems — the night before, at the latest. And as our ability to cancel classes in advance developed, so the cancellation threshold decreased.
But it need not be this way. In a very straightforward sense, Yale could reserve the cancellation of classes for the very worst snow events, like the Blizzard of 1978 or Storm Nemo in 2013. This strategy would ease the burden on professors — who, in our anecdotal experience, have reacted exclusively negatively to the most recent cancellation — to reschedule classes. It would also establish a strict line in the sand for the use of cancellation in the future.
In a broader sense, though, we students could endeavor to come to terms with the fact of our geographic location: We could realize, in other words, that New Haven is actually a place, with all its accordant consequences. Perhaps this education in the face of winter could involve something along the lines of placing shovels in every residential college entryway and requiring students to clear the walkway out front. (The knock-on effects this might have on residential college bonding might be of some interest to Dean Chun.)
“There is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather,” wrote the English critic and painter John Ruskin. We are of the same mind when it comes to snow: heavy, light or half-rain, snow is central to the essence of New England, offering a certain depth to our everyday sensory experiences. Rather than living in constant fear of what lies over the horizon, let us face the weather each day as Yalies have for over three hundred years: with heavy boots, furrowed brows and a healthy dose of hardiness.
As a senior on the track and field and cross country teams, my time at Yale has revolved around seconds, miles and a 15-minute bus schedule. Like all distance runners, each day brings its own demands, including a consistent stream of prescribed miles. Though a mile may seem to be a uniform measure of distance, each one is unique — some are colder than others, some more joyful, some faster, some darker. Regardless of the underlying conditions, however, I have found that early, solitary miles possess the great power of self-reflection.
During my first week at Yale, in the whirlwind that was first-year orientation, I recall sitting in the Timothy Dwight dining hall, wearily listening to the welcoming address of our beloved, and since retired, Head of College Jeffrey Brenzel. With a quiet intensity, he challenged each of us to accept flexibility — to acquire a “revisable definition of success.” Though I did not know it at the time, this single, simple quest to “redefine success” would become one of the greatest challenges of my undergraduate years. In looking back over the thousands of miles I have clocked on the sidewalks of New Haven, I have realized that my understanding of this challenge has transformed with each step, each setback, each loss, each victory. And, regretfully, I am confident I have failed.
Since my first year, every personal endeavor has been qualified by an overwhelming urge to pursue excellence, substantiated only in reportable athletic, social and academic triumphs. In a National Championship bid. In a competitive GPA. In fulfilled religious obligations. In attempted perfection. Now, with noticeably creakier knees and a (slightly) better understanding of Constitutional Law, I cannot honestly say that much has changed. I continue to find myself painfully ambitious and overly self-critical, and I remain wholeheartedly invested in the numbers that lie behind grades and race results. Given the conversations I have had with friends and teammates through the years, it seems many Yalies have experienced something similar.
Still, while maybe just a sore attempt to rationalize my failure to redefine success, I do not believe it is our definition of success that actually requires redefining. So much of Yale’s beauty is found in the individuals and communities that formulate, believe in and dare to pursue lofty goals and aspirations — neglecting such a fact would severely discount the true purpose and immense power of this place. Instead of revising our definitions of success, I believe it is rather the way in which we go about pursuing success that demands our reconsideration.
Like running miles, the majority of our lives consist not of monumental achievements, but of seemingly mundane, tedious and altogether unremarkable moments:
In calling grandparents and writing thank-you notes.
In encouraging friends to grow and become.
In the camaraderie of late nights spent on overdue problem sets.
In the nerves of start-line, pre-game huddles.
In making the effort to listen, to unplug.
In failed attempts, sincere apologies and honest words.
In dining hall conversations and awkward, passing smiles.
In silent, shared tears over lives and loves lost.
In honoring commitments, both great and small.
In noticing the daily opportunities to be better, to love better.
Over my time at Yale, I have found that these are the things that are actually worth acknowledging and most worth doing well. If we master the ability to recognize and harness the power of a simple moment — of a single mile — success will follow.
As we go about our daily lives here, and as we prepare to step out into this deep, wanting world, let’s be conscious of the way in which we pursue success. Let’s make a point to remind each other of our magic, to be kind. Let’s fail with grace and succeed with gratitude. Let’s go home and love our families. Let’s write letters, throw birthday parties and make every effort to look outward. Let’s fall in love and stay in love. Let’s seek to actively define and actually live what it is we believe, moment by moment. If we prioritize our moments, noticing and tending to even the smallest of encounters, we can and will leave this place in better condition than we found it. And, after all, is there truly a better definition of success?
Yes, this world needs successful people. But it is in great need of good people. We can be both. May we find the best of ourselves in the moments and miles ahead.
We fight our way out of the bustling underground of Penn Station as the train rumbles away on the steel tracks, tousling our hair and filling our ears with the roaring beat of New York City life. Traipsing up the stairs, we’re drawn into the calmness of night in a city of contradictions. The cool air teases us, nipping at our ears and toes. A curtain of darkness drapes over the sky, starless.
It’s a Tuesday night in New York, a rare moment of peace in a city that fills its corners with strains of all-too-familiar melodies and the laughter of strangers. But I can’t focus.
“Why are you walking so quickly?” my friend asks. He looks at me with a puzzled smile. My legs are shorter than his, we’re on vacation and it’s been a long night. I shouldn’t be in a hurry.
“Can I explain to you after we get back home? It’s just habit.” I ask, catching my breath. I glance behind us, for the fifth time. I spot a pair of tall figures walking in our direction and mentally ask myself if they turned with us on the last street corner. I can’t remember, but I pick up the pace anyways, keeping my eyes low to the ground. I glance at the men again, to see if their pace quickens alongside mine.
Most, if not all women reading this article will understand why I walked so quickly on that Tuesday night without explanation. They remember the echoes of their mother’s voices reminding them to always walk with a friend, check if anyone’s following you and have pepper spray on hand, even in the light of day. It’s second nature for us to keep our eyes straight ahead as we walk past men on dimly lit sidewalks, as to not to draw unnecessary attention. It’s not a conscious thought, it’s not something we talk about. It’s as natural as waking up in the morning.
The problem is that a surprising amount of men don’t understand (or do not have the chance to understand) the daily struggles of the women around them. A surprising amount of men have told me that they didn’t realize that sexual harassment is a part of daily life for women, rather than a sporadic occurrence for a select few. For women, assault doesn’t just happen to us — its gory details bind us to other women who fear speaking out. Just the other day, my best friend whispered over the phone to me that a boy had fully undressed her while she was drunk, even as she kept saying to him, “I don’t know you.” He responded by saying, “It’s okay, I like the parts of you that I do know.” She then asked me if the incident was sexual assault or not.
It’s not always about fear, either. Other times it’s about really practical issues, like the lack of trash cans or sanitary pad disposal bins in bathrooms here at Yale. Yale wasn’t built for women, and the new colleges are no exception. I wasn’t surprised when Silliman’s bathrooms lacked disposal bins, because a couple of decades ago, Silliman didn’t even have women’s bathrooms. I was shocked, however, when Benjamin Franklin, which was built this year, didn’t either. You don’t want us to talk about our periods? Fine. At least give us the luxury of concealing them behind the doors of the women’s bathroom.
Women, the conversation starts with us. We’ve been taught to keep quiet about discomfort, hiding tampons up our sleeves as we excuse ourselves in the middle of a conversation and keeping our lips sealed about our “I definitely didn’t want to do it but I wouldn’t call it rape” stories. Don’t be afraid to start uncomfortable conversations with the men around you. Tell them that you’re on your period, or that their joke is uncomfortably sexist. The power is in our words, but only if we use them.
Men, all we ask is that you listen. We don’t expect you to understand why our pace quickens as the sun sets. But we do hope that you listen when we’re brave enough to speak out about these things and fight for policies that don’t affect you, whether it’s a better system for reporting assault and rape to disposal bins in bathrooms. Speak up for us so that the burden isn’t always on us to fight daily inconveniences, in a world that was built around you and your needs.
For every uncomfortable conversation that I bridge, I make the world a bit more sensitive to the unspoken struggle that it is to be a woman, and for all the women who come after me. I’m no longer passively waiting for others to let me live in a world where I too can stand alone under the expanse of silence on a city street, utterly alone and at peace. I too, deserve the night sky.
The most remarkable thing about engineering and science majors at Yale is how many of them are also interested in the humanities. In the Center for Engineering Innovation and Design, engineering project teams are replete with students enrolled in music, English and philosophy classes. The synthesis of the sciences and the humanities is a defining characteristic of the undergraduate experience for many Yalies.
I came to Yale as a first year from a culture that saw the humanities as soft subjects for soft people. The Yale community’s unabashed embrace of the humanities was refreshing. At other schools, English teachers, for instance, justify their subject in terms of those more relevant to employment. They argue that strong communication skills are important in scientific research, or that literature informs engineers about the broad effects their inventions will have on society. This model of the humanities subordinates them to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) subjects. It denies their intrinsic worth and relegates them to second-class status. But Yale’s humanities departments don’t subscribe to this model. Instead, they present students with one of self-sufficiency. At Yale, the humanities are valuable not for the sake of the sciences but for their own sake.
Those of us who study both the humanities and the sciences do not need the latter to justify the former. Instead, our abiding interest in the humanities is justification enough. Because the study of the humanities has intrinsic value, it moves beyond simply augmenting the sciences. In fact, the study of STEM can actually augment the humanities. In my experience studying English and computer science, I have found not just that students can learn about the humanities from STEM classes, but that there are aspects of the humanities that students can only learn from STEM classes.
The study of English literature deals with human to human communication, while computer science deals with that of human to machine. Naturally, the two subjects employ many of the same techniques. Computer programming is an exercise in clarity and concision, two qualities that are essential to English writing. The main purposes of both English prose and computer code are to communicate an idea and to elicit a reaction, and although the specific mechanisms used to achieve these purposes differ, the process of writing is the same. Programming teaches the student how to distill an abstract idea into words, structure a coherent argument from disparate components and revise a written draft. It also brings an awareness of the effects that words have on their reader, whether that reader is a human or a computer. When writing English prose, it is easy to make the mistake of merely documenting one’s own thoughts without considering how to communicate them to others. Computer programming requires the writer to explain ideas so clearly that even a dumb machine can understand them.
Obviously, these skills are not unique to computer science, and students can certainly learn them in the comfortable confines of the English Department. But programming presents the fundamentals of writing in a way that makes them easier to learn. Clean, well-written code strips away the frills and complications of English prose, reducing language to its most basic elements.
Most people who take computer science classes don’t become significantly better writers or more perceptive readers, but that is because neither they nor the professor are trying to apply the course material to that end. Someone who reads a Shakespeare sonnet focusing solely on the use of capital letters does not necessarily gain a better understanding of its artistic qualities. STEM classes are generally not designed to teach students anything about the arts, but an interested student can leverage them to do just that.
Computer science deals with areas of language that are far more advanced than anything covered in English classes. Even the modernist writers, who vastly expanded the conception of what literature could be, never went as far as the programmers have. As I said before, literature is written for a human reader, while code is typically designed for an inhuman machine. Remarkably, however, computer scientists have devised techniques, such as tail recursion, which enable them to phrase algorithms in a way that is elegant to a human and also efficient for a computer. With this technique, the same piece of writing communicates optimally with both the human and the inhuman reader. In this way, computer code fundamentally alters our understanding of language and communication.
Computer science, for me, does not merely augment the study of English, it advances it. I encourage my fellow humanities majors to venture up Science Hill: not to get jobs after college, not to gain respect from society, but to deepen their understanding of the humanities in ways they only can by studying STEM.
A few weeks ago, I was discussing a column in the News with some friends. A sophomore overheard us and began to complain about how terrible the author was. Curious, I asked her whether she had met, spoken or interacted with the author. She replied that she hadn’t, but many people she knew in her service group disliked him, and she trusted their judgment.
As I’ve written before, Yalies pick teams and stick with them. That is, we define our identities by the clubs and activities that we participate in. And the most virtuous teams we can be a part of are the student activist groups across campus. Over the past four years, Yale’s been seeing a wave of protests that have spanned everything from fossil fuel divestment to gender inclusion in fraternities to the student income contribution. At the forefront of these protests have been activist groups such as Fossil Free Yale, Engender and Students Unite Now — all of which are well-intentioned institutions that serve as perfectly valid answers to the question, “What do you do around campus?” But if members of these groups are as hesitant to make their own judgments as this sophomore was, we’re in trouble. Since activism is an identity at Yale, I worry that single-issue groups mean well but often act in ways that are counterproductive to their own ends because of this myopia.
To see what I mean, consider Trump’s recent ban of transgender troops in the military. As Eli Massey and Yasmin Nair pointed out in Current Affairs last week, it’s obviously unfair to deny transgender people the right to serve on the basis of their gender identity, but LGBTQ+ activist organizations like the Human Rights Campaign often waste their limited political capital framing this issue in terms of “‘inclusion’ versus ‘discrimination’” instead of grappling with bigger issues first. The military still faces massive issues with racism, sexism and mental health concerns. Why, Massey and Nair argue, would anyone fight for the “equal right to be mistreated and subjugated”? Why not first push the military to address the structural injustices that make trans soldiers, who are already vulnerable, “even more susceptible to social, cultural, and mental crises”?
It seems to me that the Human Rights Campaign missed the forest for the trees here, and I think that’s in large part because it’s a single-issue group. It’s only natural for an LGBTQ+ advocacy group to react instinctively to the immediate injustice of a transgender troop ban instead of considering whether transgender individuals should actually want to be in the military today. Similarly, single-issue activism at Yale runs the risk of fighting the wrong battles.
For example, activists at Yale have pointed out that fraternities create toxic climates for women and are trying to reform them by getting them to admit women. Unsurprisingly, they’ve been met with resistance, and I’d be surprised if Yale frat boys suddenly became more enlightened. If fraternities are so bad, wouldn’t it make more sense to advocate banning them outright rather than spending a decade and a half trying to reform them from the inside?
I’m genuinely not sure what the answer to this question is, but I’m not sure anyone else does either. And if students base our identities around our activism, I fear that we’re prone to take criticism of our tactics as an indictment of our character. Indeed, if the recent vicious rhetoric between student activists and Chief Investment Officer David Swensen over divestment concerns was any indication, we already do.
Political scientist Robert Putnam once wrote about two types of social groups: bonding groups, which “sustain particularized (in-group)” characteristics, and bridging groups, which connect heterogeneous groups of people. Both are important, but it seems that social activism at Yale often fosters more bonding between the like-minded than bridging between activists and those who disagree with them. The public spat between the News, Swensen and the activists was regrettable and unlikely to have convinced anyone of very much — and it likely got as personal as it did because of how much identity and activism have become intertwined.
This isn’t to say that we should separate the personal from the political. It’s hard for anyone to criticize students who feel as though there is some injustice in the world for trying to organize and address it. Some of the most meaningful debates we can have involve deeply personal issues. But when activism as an identity hampers activism as a task, there’s a problem. However virtuous our intentions may be, virtue in a vacuum has no value at all.

This has been a transformative year for Yale, and we in Yale College Council leadership have been working diligently to build a new, more representative student government that remains at the forefront of student-driven campus improvements and initiatives. We have presided over the first expansion of Yale College’s student body in a generation, the closing of Commons and the transitioning in of a new College dean. Ours is a new Yale, redefined in the wake of 2015 activism.
Despite these changes, YCC’s mission remains the same: to make the Yale experience more accessible for all students, present and future. YCC has been and continues to be the primary advocate for policy change on campus. A new $4,000 domestic internship grant, increased time to declare a class Credit/D/Fail, the first ever credit-bearing American Sign Language classes, the creation of the Secretary’s Advisory Committee to empower student voices in our school administration — the list of YCC’s real and tangible impact goes on and on. We are proud of our members’ accomplishments, and we continue to develop and implement new solutions to the everyday challenges faced by our students. While change at Yale may sometimes come slowly or only after significant campus conversation, this year has proven that there is new momentum and strong partners who want to hear students’ voices and make tangible changes.
YCC may focus on the Yale undergraduate experience, but our impact shapes futures far beyond the Yale bubble. By providing the resources for students to belong and succeed here as undergraduates, we ensure that Yale continues to nurture leaders in fields as diverse as academia, politics, medicine, business and the arts. And so we have worked to build a more equitable campus, one in which we can all access the resources necessary to succeed here in our own unique way. A Yale where everyone can live up to their potential is a powerful place with the capacity to move the world. And that Yale is exactly what YCC strives to create.
To achieve this goal, YCC needs you. The more voices in student government, the stronger our representation becomes. Whether you’re majoring in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology or history of art, a member of Students Unite Now or a Buckley fellow, from down the road or across the world, there is a place for you in YCC. YCC provides a tangible opportunity to make change on this campus, so if you are interested in making a more equitable Yale, having a say in University decisions or representing your college, YCC is the place to bring your voice. As an organization and as a campus, we have made a lot of progress in the past several years, but there is always still much more to be done, systems to be reformed and long-persisting legacies to be addressed. This work must be carried forth by a new generation of Yalies and a new set of student government leaders representative of our new Yale. We’ve redefined the internal tools and processes to reflect a new set of values for YCC. Now it’s up to you to bring about the change you wish to see on campus and in the world.
Yale needs you. Run for the 2018–19 Yale College Council. The deadline to register is Thursday, April 5 at 5 p.m.
Welcome to late March: the season of senior society tap. Society tap is perhaps the thing at Yale with worst ratio of “potential to be good” to “is actually good.” This is not to say that there is not something wonderful about society, singular, the intimate group of 16 people. There is, absolutely. But alongside the friendship of a society is the system of socially divisive societies, plural, a corrosive and exclusive organism of suddenly stratified Yale social life.
Society tap ruptures the logic of pre-society Yale social life. In the first three years of college, Yale has a horizontal hierarchy that hinges on the tacit agreement that people do different things because they like to do different things. Some people go out; some do not. Those are both choices, each no better or no worse than the other.
Society tap changes that logic by demanding a new social verticality, tarring college with a high school brush. If you get many letters — or if you are interviewed by one of the eight landed societies — then you’ve “succeeded” according to all discernible Yale metrics. If you don’t — or you don’t get tapped at all — then it seems like you didn’t. That’s a myth, but one worth unraveling with suggestions to improve the system.
The first honest response to the myth is: No, landed societies are not better. This is true. Everyone enters their society not knowing most of the group, and almost everyone graduates with new friendships developed over senior year. Society, singular, demands that you commit to ritual and uphold a basic promise that you will be there when you said you’d be there. You cannot be in a society and think your time is more important that everyone else’s — something essential for every Yale student to learn before entering adulthood.
Furthermore, the experience of telling your life story in the form of an hourslong “bio,” and listening to 15 other life stories in turn, is rare. The tradition of bios started after World War II as an affirmation that American leaders could only be agents of global prosperity if they could introspect. A Yale adult would be a person who could listen and reflect, a firmly planted individual who could hold others’ stories alongside their own. In some ways, that worked. Listening to bios really does demand thoughtfulness, kindness and patience. Telling your bio does the same. That is a beautiful, standardized experience in all societies.
But yet, but yet. The other honest response to the myth is: Yes, landed societies are better. This is also true. They have tombs, private chefs who cook dinner and well-endowed alumni networks. They demand a formality of time that necessarily forces closer friendships. There is something real about sharing food together. There is also something real about the difference between spending six hours together every week and spending ten or twelve. A delight and simultaneous devastation of landed societies is that, by sheer virtue of time, many of their seniors graduate with a new cadre of best friends. In the best-case scenario, that’s nice. But in the worst-case scenario, these new friendships can supplant those from the rest of college. It’s an artificial social change that doesn’t happen as often in nonlanded societies. But maybe that’s not such a bad thing.
The least-discussed perk of that being in a landed society has nothing to do with the group itself and everything to do with the strange cult of “society mixers,” parties available only to landed societies and held in tombs. It would be one thing if everyone who chooses to do society were placed into their societies — some landed, some not — and then everyone forgot about everyone else’s society for the rest of senior year. But these parties propagate the sense of bourgeois exclusivity floating over tap week well into senior year.
Choosing to interact as whole-unit society fails the mission. Societies are meant to be places of reflection, trust and inclusion. Although the structure is inherently exclusive, the large amount of societies let many seniors sink deeply into strangers’ lives, an experience worth consideration. That feels tainted when only a few societies in a few clusters throw parties in their tombs, a circuit that comes to choke parts of senior social life.
So, to Yale’s next crop of landed gentry, I have a suggestion: Either open your tombs to seniors invited regardless of society affiliation or don’t throw parties at all. And to Yale’s next group of seniors even thinking about society, I’ll say this: I like my society. I’ve made deep and lasting friendships there. And there’s a lot to be learned from practicing kindness in this way. But society is a sacrifice of time — a real sacrifice of time — and one not to be made lightly. If you’re not getting letters, that might sting in the moment, but you may very well have a much better senior year. So when you’re choosing whether or not to participate, consider this: The more you can do to make college feel less like high school, the happier your senior year will be.
Right before spring break, I was having a conversation with a friend about how we were finding our classes thus far. “I just feel like there are competing incentives when it comes to our education here,” she sighed. “Like, if it comes between doing all of my reading thoroughly, and writing my essay that gets me my grade, I’ll blow off my reading and spend my time writing,” she continued. “It’s sad, but it’s true.”
As Yale students, we’re constantly balancing aspects of our lives. To go to Woads, or not to go to Woads? To get some exercise, or to finish tomorrow’s assignment? And one of the most frustrating balancing acts we face, when it comes to our education, is that of balancing our idealism and our pragmatism.
Indeed, there are two competing incentives regarding our education: that of learning for learning’s sake and the very real drive to ensure we have the best GPA possible for our post-graduation plans. When we don’t adequately balance these incentives, there is a pronounced tension that shifts the focus of our education from the joy of learning to a type of calculated grade groveling.
Consider the statistics. When asked about their expected plans for the fall following graduation, nearly one fifth of the class of 2016 said that they planned on attending graduate or professional school. For this chunk of students, having a stellar academic record will make a tangible difference in their graduate school acceptances.
Moreover, in that very same Office of Career Strategy poll, a whopping three quarters of the class of 2016 responded that they planned on entering the workforce. And when it comes to the elite finance, consulting and governmental positions, applicants’ GPAs are absolutely vital. Even if most of those respondents didn’t have Goldman or Boston Consulting Group aspirations, their academic records are still fundamental parts of any job application.
And there is very clear logic behind why any employer would value an applicant’s GPA. If our GPAs measure how well we did in college and we assume that our grades are the outcome of our hard work and wit, then our GPAs are helpful indicators of our competencies.
Now, the question becomes: What happens when these goals that require pristine GPAs collide with our goals of learning for learning’s sake? Are the two mutually exclusive? Most importantly, which goal should we value more?
To address the first question, Yale is filled with ambitious and eager people. For many, prioritizing graded work over ungraded work is hard-wired. Indeed, in my first semester and a half here, I’ve been knee-deep in these types of academic trade-offs. Time and time again, I’ve chosen to start an essay or a reading response instead of working all the way through a mountainous ungraded reading assignment.
But I feel an acute guilt for doing this … like I’m cheating myself out of the education I have worked so hard to get.
“It’s sad, but it’s true.”
As to the second question — whether or not learning for the sake of learning is mutually exclusive with pursuing a high GPA, it certainly doesn’t need to be. I spoke with a friend of mine about this problem, and he told me about his US National Elections class. There, the goal of learning is intimately tied with how one is graded — there are five low-pressure essays that can be written on anything throughout the semester that students find interesting.
Now, I am no Blue Book expert, and there are certainly other courses designed like that one, but I am more concerned with the work-heavy courses in which our ideal and pragmatic approaches to our education don’t coexist as easily.
To be clear, this is not a sob fest about the amount of work being thrown at us. On the contrary, we’re highly capable people — we can handle heavy workloads.
I simply wish to underscore the frustration at being pulled in two equally compelling, but opposite directions by these competing incentives. However, I think these competing incentives are reconcilable. In the long run, statistically, the majority of us do have a vested interest in ensuring that our GPAs are competitive for our post-college plans. So there is a pressure to succeed.
But this pressure needs to be balanced with how we approach our classes on the margin. On a week-by-week scale, our approaches to our classes shouldn’t be consumed by foreboding thoughts about how every little move we make will affect our grades. Indeed, if we are able to balance how we approach our classes in the long run and how we approach our classes on the margin, the frustration of our competing incentives can be diffused.
Around this time each year, the perennial question resurfaces: What do I do this summer? And, if you’re one of the two-thirds of seniors who won’t be in the all-entangling tresses of consulting or finance next year, the question could simply be: What do I do?
My answer to you? Something completely different. After graduating last May, I spent four months writing for a small community newspaper in a town of 900 people on the Missouri banks of the Mississippi. And I majored in biochemistry and am heading to medical school in the fall. Go figure.
I’ll be honest, I had my doubts. I considered doing something that made more sense, like working in a cancer lab, interning at an urban health clinic or writing for a science magazine, ideally while living in, of course, New York City. Or literally anything else that wouldn’t leave medical schools and future employers scratching their heads trying to figure out if it was ADHD or split personality disorder that I was on prescriptions for.
The internship wasn’t what any Yalie would consider “a Yale thing to do.” But because it was so different, it was also deeply transformative, opening my eyes to a completely different side of reality.
During my time there, I discussed politics with farmers proudly wearing red Trump hats. I spoke with civil engineers who expressed frustrations at how much easier it was for East Coast activists to support the Clean Water Act than for blue-collar workers to carry out its dictates. I met a girl my age who was already a mother, a guy just one year older who was driving trucks for a living and a lady my grandmother’s age who worked two jobs and visited her daughter in prison on the weekends.
I am by no means trying to demean the people of small-town America. They were in fact some of the kindest and most principled people I’ve ever met. But they were also different from me in so many ways, and it was these differences that planted the seeds of personal growth.
I’ll give you an example. A couple months ago, as I was pounding out some calories on a treadmill at my local gym, my eyes landed on the TV above me. Sean Hannity was on. Suddenly, I realized something. For the first time, I understood why anyone would ever watch Fox News. It was because the anchors, whether it was Hannity, O’Reilly or Baier, literally looked and sounded like many of the people I had met in Missouri. They could have been backyard neighbors. They had the same twang in their voices, the same sparkle of midwestern congeniality in their faces. And I realized that a part of me had always subconsciously deemed them less knowledgeable and less trustworthy, precisely because they were so different.
I turned my eyes to the next screen, which was playing CNN. Anderson Cooper was on in all his snowy splendor. Cooper, Zakaria, Tapper — these were the kind of intellectual elites I had shared rooms with at Yale and eaten lunch with in Commons. But after my four months in Missouri, they were like aliens to me.
Yalies are undeniably a group of uber-privileged people. No matter what background you come from, we are all immersed in a culture soaked in aristocratic elitism and spend four years swimming in it. By the end of your time here, it will have changed you even if you don’t immediately realize how. I saw it happen to almost all of my friends at Yale, and it’s sure to happen to you — if you let it. If you don’t want to graduate more detached from the world than you were as a first year, make an effort to get out and understand the people this world is made of. Call up a Florida fishery and ask to work on one of their boats for a month. Move to a town in Idaho — remember that state? — and work at McDonald’s for a few weeks. Be uncomfortable. It’ll be the kind of learning that really sticks.
As humans, we have a critical problem. We fail to understand people who developed in a different background from us, and we tend to skirt past the difficult conversations needed to tackle these misunderstandings. What if white nationalists could understand what it’s like to grow up in a war-torn country dreaming of a better life for your family? What if anti-abortion activists spent a week speaking with single mothers in line at abortion clinics? What if climate change skeptics were to spend a year working in a NOAA research lab? A more civil, peaceful and enlightened society might be closer than we thought.
So this summer, this fall or even today, get out and experience another side of reality. Be uncomfortable. A better future is at stake.
Addressing my freshman class in 2014, University President Peter Salovey said that “the pursuit of new knowledge … requires that we confront what we would prefer to avoid, that we engage when it would be far more comfortable to disengage.” To drive home the point, he cited several passages from the Woodward Report, Yale’s seminal document on academic freedom. There would be cases, Salovey concluded, in which “meaningful lessons can only be learned by gritting our teeth and then arguing back” — in which the answer to offensive speech, premeditated or otherwise, would be more speech of our own.
Fast forward to October of the following year, when Erika and Nicholas Christakis came under fire for telling students that if you didn’t like someone’s Halloween costume, you should say so. Their main points — that University bureaucrats had no business policing free expression, that the solution to bad speech was more speech, not less, that offense could sometimes serve a valuable purpose — were an almost verbatim restatement of Salovey’s.
Instead of defending the Christakises, however, Salovey sent out a campuswide email detailing the need to make sure “all members of our community truly feel welcome.”
“We begin this work by laying to rest the claim that it conflicts with our commitment to free speech,” he elaborated, apparently forgetting that this conflict is the whole point of the Woodward Report: “Without sacrificing its central purpose, [the University] cannot make its primary and dominant value the fostering of friendship, solidarity, harmony, civility, or mutual respect.” To deny that trade-off, as Salovey did explicitly, is to deny the axiom on which all of Yale’s free speech policies are based.
Never mind that the Woodward Report posits a “positive obligation … shared by all members of the community” to promote free expression for everyone else. At no point did Salovey chastise the myriad students who had shirked this obligation; at no point did he acknowledge that two Yale professors were being burned in effigy for saying exactly what he had said just a year earlier. By the time campus returned to normal, Salovey not only sold out the Christakises but also his own principles — assuming he had them to begin with.
That assumption grew more dubious in 2016, when Salovey announced the initial decisions on “master” and “Calhoun.”
“The use of ‘master,’” he conceded, was part of an “ancient collegiate tradition” that had nothing to do with slavery. But because it was not “intrinsically tied to Yale’s history … the reasons to change the title of ‘master’ proved more compelling than the reasons to keep it.” Salovey’s argument was contradictory on its face. The “ancient collegiate tradition” to which “master” belonged is the same one that spawned modern research universities such as Yale, which emphasize academic mastery over a craft; replacing this title with the corporate-sounding “head of college” would obviously estrange Yale from its pedagogical roots, corroding a time-honored tradition with bureaucratic glut.
Meanwhile Calhoun was causing more people more discomfort, and for better reasons, than an Oxbridge holdover used for centuries without umbrage. But here Salovey took a stand. He couldn’t allow outrage or ochlocracy to rebrand a “much-beloved” residential college, even one named for an avowed white supremacist.
The adjective gave it away: Changing Calhoun might have angered alumni and hurt Yale’s bottom line; axing “master” posed no such risk. I suspect Salovey thought that by making strategic concessions to the activists, he could avoid another PR fiasco and hold onto donors.
Until he couldn’t. Students began protesting the decision as soon as it was announced, and after Fox News had made “shrieking girl” its go-to punching bag for the better part of six months, Salovey decided the best way to save face would be to remove any further cause for conflagration. So the administration convened the “Committee to Establish Principles on Renaming” — whose precepts seemed designed to leave alone everything but Calhoun — and set about pawning off rank capitulation as prudent governance. That Calhoun would change was never in doubt once the question had been reopened; doubling down again would have sown chaos, which Salovey wanted desperately to avoid.
It should go without saying that there is nothing principled about inventing an entire list of guidelines and regulations just so you can justify surrender to public opinion. These reversals no doubt fueled the perception of a spineless, weak-willed Salovey, who appears utterly incapable of standing up for what he believes.
But in many ways, this diagnosis gives Yale’s 23rd president far too much credit. His is not the stewardship of a man who understands his duty but lacks the will to execute it. Rather, the Salovey regime takes its cues from The Organization Kid whose heyday has come and gone — managerial, efficiency-minded and thoroughly amoral. Perhaps this is why it commands such universal disdain: In a climate of protest and paroxysm, feckless leaders make for dangerous enemies.
Since the start of the year, University President Peter Salovey has redoubled his efforts to enact his “Academic Strategy.” To this end, he has announced a focus on data-intensive social science and discussed a new public policy school. As Yale prepares for a new capital campaign, these initiatives may define the University’s future scholarly output.
But the banality of terms like “data” and “policy” elides the blind spots they entail. And unless students and scholars recognize their limits, the future will read like a dystopian novel, if not a downright farce.
Recent events illustrate the limitations of quantitative research. For decades, economists increasingly have relied on mathematical modeling at the expense of qualitative approaches like economic history, yet economic models failed to predict the Great Recession of 2008. In political science, advanced polling techniques similarly forecast neither Brexit nor Donald Trump. Meanwhile, psychology confronts a replication crisis, with nearly two-thirds of published results failing the test of reproducibility. In short, disciplines that underwent a “quantitative revolution” in the middle of the 20th century are experiencing a counterrevolution in the 21st.
Some might argue that the solution is more data, but the problem is not just technical. Data privileges the aggregate over the particular, presuming coherence in an often-contradictory world. It entrenches our worst biases, as evidenced by a Google program that tagged black faces as gorillas or a risk assessment algorithm that wrongly identified black defendants as more likely to reoffend.
Most critically, data cannot answer the hard, normative questions that elites are all too keen to avoid. In a recent piece in Scientific American, Salovey championed “data-driven decision-making over ideology.” Indeed, many Yalies believe that the “masses” will come around to our positions, if only they were better informed. But data alone cannot adjudicate trade-offs between competing interests, which are invariably ideological. What is the appropriate balance between promoting economic development today and preserving the environment for tomorrow? How do we reconcile the fact that trade and immigration create growth but also depress the wages of low-income earners? Data can inform our value judgments but cannot make them on our behalf.
The cousin of data, “policy,” shares many of these pitfalls. Policy research answers the “how” but not the “what” or “why.” The conceit of data-driven policy-making is that it is ideologically neutral, when all it does is mask its own ideological tenor. Good policy cannot exist without robust politics, which ultimately requires an interrogation of political philosophy. A public policy school trains students in technocratic governance, but a university like Yale must also prepare students for citizenship in a deliberative democracy.
To be clear, I am no Luddite: Policy, technology and quantitative data are all integral to the work of the University. But we must not presume their authority over other ways of knowing. Individual stories, historical experiences and ethnographic insights are data, as much as large-scale statistical datasets. Similarly, technology does not have to be digital to be fit for purpose. To use a simple illustration, students learn better when they take notes with pen and paper rather than a laptop. That’s not because technology is bad, but because paper itself is a technology, with benefits that are not immediately apparent but nonetheless material.
As we embrace the promise of big data, we must never lose sight of the value of imagination, intuition and inspiration. Salovey’s own career evinces the importance of spontaneous ideation. In the summer of 1987, John Mayer — who studied human intelligence — was helping Salovey — who studied emotions — paint his new house in New Haven. While applying a second coat to the living room wall, the duo developed the idea of “emotional intelligence.” In their seminal 1990 paper, they outlined their vision of emotional intelligence without a single statistic, opening with a quotation from the first-century-B.C. writer Publilius Syrus. That’s the kind of work we stand to lose if we prize quantification over all else.
We have been here before. In 1965, IBM sponsored a conference at Yale on “Computers for the Humanities.” A poster from the conference hangs in the Digital Humanities Lab, which will move into a swanky new space in Sterling Memorial Library once renovations are complete. To me, the poster is an omen. The computational turn in the 1960s and 1970s ultimately faltered, as scholars devoted their time to creating comprehensive datasets and running analyses that bore little relation to reality. As a reviewer of the conference wrote, “Some foolish studies are being done and many will be done.” We would do well to remember that admonition.
At Yale, our task is to build a future that is technologically guided but people-focused; data-informed but values-driven. Unlike that school up north, our motto is more expansive than a statistically significant Veritas. It is Lux et Veritas.
From a young age, I have grappled with ideas of transience and permanence. Like many children, I panicked when I couldn’t find my toy or when a parent left the room. I wanted everything to stay where I could see it, in perpetuity. As I’ve grown older, I’ve learned that impermanence imbues adolescence and adulthood, yet I haven’t gotten much better at letting go.
At Yale, we often like to maintain our relationships with people rather than let them slip away. This becomes more difficult as we drift apart from people when we’re no longer in the same seminars or extracurriculars and we don’t have reason to see them regularly. We schedule meals or coffees to catch up with people we haven’t seen in months, but many times our interactions don’t extend past this point. We grab the meal, and we don’t see each other again for months.
Of course, each of us is busy, and we can’t maintain every friendship that begins to slip away and we shouldn’t be expected to. But I think that we could reflect more upon our relationships here and whether we are maintaining them in a shallow way. In other words, we can all try to be more genuine with one another. We all deserve to spend time with those who want to spend time with us, and, to that end, I’ve begun to accept that it’s okay to grow apart from people. It is a natural process, along with the rising and setting of the sun. I’ve always wanted to hold onto people, to remember the meaningful experiences we’ve shared, and therefore I’ve resisted the idea of growing apart. Now, I’ve understood that growing apart doesn’t necessarily mean that those moments have been forgotten, but rather simply that people can coalesce and intersect and move in different directions.
Relatedly, I’ve recently started reflecting on why I’ve always resisted growing apart from people, even when I feel that I’m grasping at threads of fading relationships. Part of the reason, I’ve found, is resistance to the idea of loneliness. And yet, some of my happiest moments at Yale have come from solitude — eating lunch alone in Davenport dining hall, when I can remember the day’s events and classes and moments with friends I bumped into on the streets, or sitting on a bench on Cross Campus, watching people come together and break apart like molecules.
When we understand that solitude is not synonymous with loneliness and accept the inevitability of growing apart from people, we can be much more honest and open with ourselves and others. Recently, I talked with a friend about how sometimes we wish we could strike up conversations with people we want to get to know better or with whom we share common interests and passions, but talking to someone out of the blue might be considered strange. We should move towards erasing this conception, for it limits our own personal growth, barring us from befriending people who might offer us new perspectives. We can become less fixed in our conception of friend groups at Yale, seeing our peers not as people attached to certain social circles or groups but instead just as individuals whose stories we have yet to hear.
A while ago, during fall recess, I took the train back from my suitemate’s home in Manhattan. As I looked around, I noticed a mother with her daughter sleeping on her shoulder, two teenagers sitting in each other’s company and yet both fixated on their phones and a middle-aged man pensively gazing out the window. I did not know any of these people, and yet I wondered about their stories and the precise composition of each of their lives. I thought about how at each hour, several trains filled with sets of completely different people would start on their divergent paths. They would keep coming and going.
Over spring break, I stayed in New Haven and decided to walk through Old Campus one day. I noticed how silent it felt with everyone gone, the trees hunching over, the whole space empty except for the buildings. I thought of all the graduations that took place and would take place here, the chaos of Spring Fling, the groups of students that would soon lay on the grass or on blankets in the sunny weather. Old Campus stood still, and these images shuffled in and out of my mind like the trains, continually coming and going. None of us can know every person on this campus, and none of us can predict or dictate the span of our friendships and relationships. All we can hope to do is to connect with some individuals, even if it is ephemeral, to let them be part of our lives and ourselves part of theirs — and perhaps this itself is meaningful.
You are extraordinary. You go to a school that has an acceptance rate of less than 6.5–7 percent (thanks class of 2021.) You study under and among the world’s leading minds; you attend an idyllic, storied institution. It took a lot to get here, and even then, your acceptance was by no means guaranteed (unless you’re a legacy). And above all of these extraordinary facts, you are uniquely you. Your interests might range from history to molecular, cellular and developmental biology; you might play for a varsity team and sing in an a cappella group. Hell, this description might fit more than a single person here. Put simply, you are special — like a snowflake. You are uniquely you, [insert your name here].
Except there are lots of people at this school, even if we’re at a “small” university in Connecticut. There are probably lots of other people in your major, maybe even hundreds. There are countless pre-med, pre-law, pre-consulting students out there, just like you. And let’s not even think about the fact that you’re just here at a particular moment in time.
Actually, let’s. Think about all the classes that came before you, all of the hundreds and thousands of people who had the same interests, the same background, the same aspirations. You’re an editor at the News? How special, there’ll never be another like you — oh wait, the next editor is sitting in front of you for their desk edit, and one day, they’ll be in the same position. And even that’s not special, considering this system has been in place for the last one hundred and forty years. You write columns for the News? Yeah, there haven’t been enough columnists in the past century. Even if you call yourself a part of something new, whether you be a PauliMur, a member of the latest group or a statistics and data science major, the novelty of each of those things is ephemeral. There will be more colleges (the mascot for Schwartzman College? Schwartzmen); there will be more groups and there will be more majors. If it’s the case that we’re each a snowflake, then we’re a part of the latest nor’easter.
I once had a professor who emphasized a particular quote from Edmund Burke, the famed critic of the French Revolution. To paraphrase Burke, custom, history, tradition — this is the bedrock of civilization. Without a meaningful connection to tradition in all of its forms, we “would become little better than the flies of summer.” We’d melt as soon as our crystalline composition graced the ground. We need an established layer of snow or frozen ground to stick. Tradition fulfills that role.
Burke would have thought that we’d come to the right place, then. After all, “Yale is at once a tradition …” But what happens when tradition erases the individual, when tradition is so overbearing there’s no escaping it? I once read about a student who passed away in a car crash in the ’80s. Some people said he could have been president. Another student who passed away just a few years ago had a bright future ahead of her. She was a young writer, and we can only imagine the heights to which she would have soared. But even in death, there’s a degree to which these students’ individuality is lost, or at least diminished. The death of any young person is tragic, but there’s always an added sense of tragedy when we learn that the deceased went to Yale. After all, this is a place that produces presidents and Pulitzer Prize winners. In this sense, Yale is a brand that we will carry forever, happily more than otherwise. And even those among us who would seek to distance ourselves from Yale because it’s elitist or evil will never be able to deny that the Yale name grants them immeasurable benefits.
But where would we be without a connection to something larger than ourselves? It’s no coincidence that classes like “The Life Worth Living,” and “Psychology and the Good Life” are insanely popular. While we’re not the Lost Generation, we’re lost in a different sense. In a world that tells us to value the ephemeral, in a world that tells us to mock and scorn the very idea of the eternal, it’s easy to see why so many wonder about how to lead a good life, a worthy life.
On the question of individuality and tradition, then, as with so many others, the answer involves balance. Balance between losing yourself among your many predecessors and the hubris of thinking that you are so much different than those next to you, those who came before you and those who will come after you. Marina Keegan ’12, the writer I referenced earlier, wrote in an essay published in the News that we all think ourselves special. A future generation, “flying its tiny cars,” as she wrote, would be no exception. “Until one day, vaguely, quietly, the sun would flicker out and they’d realize that none of us are. Or that all of us are.”
“Murder my pussy without the gunshot / Just shoot me up my ass crack with a cum shot”: even if these lyrics don’t inspire you, hopefully this column will.
I’ve been a sincere fan of Cupcakke for over a year — since 2016, when her music video for “LGBT” became a sensation in the queer community for its powerful message of self-love. In the song, Cupcakke’s brand of queer advocacy was nothing short of revolutionary. She didn’t provide the cringe-worthy “Love is Love” message espoused by other gay songs (ahem, Macklemore). She didn’t depict queerness as a straight-laced suburban white couple with an equality bumper sticker. No, Cupcakke’s “LGBT” embraced queer sexuality in all its dirty glory. The song is fun and raunchy while remaining political. She even uncommonly acknowledges the diverse spectrum of queer identities: “Shout out to the bis, you don’t gotta pick a side / And if you in the closet shorty you ain’t gotta hide.” The single’s cover depicts Cupcakke standing at a presidential podium, middle fingers up, in front of a rainbow flag. F— the haters.
Around the time “LGBT” gained popularity, Cupcakke’s other work was gaining traction among queer and straight listeners alike. Her repertoire of songs is incredibly diverse. Cupcakke — the stage name of Elizabeth Eden Harris — raps about childhood sexual abuse (“Pedophile”), self-hatred (“Self-Interview”), body image (“Biggie Smalls”) and, perhaps most famously, about sex. Regardless of her subject matter, she gives us unshakable self-confidence and the cleverest wordplay of any rapper in the business. Though her rhymes are often funny, Cupcakke’s music isn’t just a party gag — her adept lyricism has garnered attention by highbrow critics. Her ratings on Pitchfork, a notoriously stringent music criticism site, rival those of rappers like Drake and Lil Wayne. And did I mention she’s only twenty years old?
Cupcakke’s music is no contrived commercial feat. She rose to internet fame from humble beginnings, all because of her clever wordplay and, most importantly, her inspiring outlook. Cupcakke preaches a message that’s hard to come by: that we are beautiful not despite our “flaws”, but because of them. She builds on a proud tradition of black female artists like Aretha Franklin, Janet Jackson, Missy Elliott and Rihanna, who defy a white supremacist culture by taking pride in their sexuality. She’s proud of her fetishes, her body hair and her stretchmarks. In her words: “Size 7 or 11, I’mma still be a hottie.”
A recent column in the News excoriated Cupcakke for using profane lyrics. Cupcakke’s profanity is undeniable — if you don’t like profanity, you shouldn’t listen to Cupcakke, or most other rap. But it is unfair to dismiss the importance of Cupcakke’s work because of its profanity. In fact, in profanity and crudeness lies a lot of courage and bravery. For femme and queer people, especially femme and queer people of color, Cupcakke is the rare artist who speaks with total liberation about sex — and she does it with a unique combination of dirtiness and comedic flare. You can’t tell me “Coochie guaranteed to put you to sleep so damn soon / Ridin’ on your dick I’m readin’ ‘Goodnight Moon’” isn’t genius.
The most objectionable claim made in opposing columns is that Cupcakke’s sexually explicit lyrics encourage an unhealthy sexual climate. This argument is terribly misguided. The singular piece of evidence some have provided to support that claim is a line from her popular song “Deepthroat,” whose line “daddy better make me choke” some authors have conflated with encouragement of rape culture. There is no line in Cupcakke’s music that supports rape culture. When Cupcakke raps “Daddy better make me choke,” it is a sincere expression of a consensual act that many of us desire in the bedroom. In fact, Cupcakke’s lyrics critique rape culture at every turn. In the very same song, Cupcakke disparages the use of alcohol as a way to entice someone into a hookup: “Don’t need no drink to get naughty / ’Cause bitch I’m not Bill Cosby.”
I’m thrilled to see Cupcakke perform at Spring Fling, and I’m proud of the Spring Fling committee for choosing such a groundbreaking artist. I also have tickets to see Cupcakke this month, so I’ll be seeing her twice. I hope she performs “Spoiled Milk Titties” — that’s one of my favorites.
See you in the spring!
Yale students are smart. And they are certainly compassionate. Too often, though, students let passion rule common sense. Sometimes, they make up words like “invisibilizes” or “logics” to conceal their failures at eloquence in the News’ Opinion section. Often, they advocate fiercely for causes which they fundamentally misunderstand; sometimes with good intentions, usually out of self-righteousness.
But when liberal students en masse wrongly attack the single most progressive investment model used by universities across the country, then they deserve to be called out. If it weren’t for Chief Investment Officer David Swensen’s endowment strategy, I and many other low-income students across the world could never have even dreamed of coming to a place like Yale.
Put simply, the perfectly ethical investment model which activists envision would bankrupt the University and revert it back to the rich white boys’ club that they claim it once was. It should be obvious that divestment from all companies deemed even slightly immoral — by the activists’ standards — coupled with an extreme redistribution of leftover funding toward free tuition and additional support to New Haven — a job which has nothing to do with the endowment, by the way — is economically infeasible. Yale doesn’t literally have a renewable pot of $27 billion from which it can dip into whenever a socially righteous cause presents itself. The endowment is mostly liquid and will deplete in any given year if not spent wisely and protected through future investments. Tuition grants to low-income students, current levels of support to New Haven, research money to support — yes — socially righteous causes, and funding toward — gasp — the hiring of a more diverse faculty, intellectually or otherwise, are all dependent on a healthy endowment.
And as far as investing goes, Yale’s model is already more ethical than most. Swensen himself has previously criticized Wall Street for losing its “moral foundation,” according to a 2013 article in the News (“Swensen criticizes Wall Street”), and in 2014 he spearheaded an investing movement away from fossil fuel companies and toward companies that support renewable energy. Students protested this partial divestment in 2016 as only fueled by financial incentive, but Swensen has already addressed those concerns many times over. It’s as if students will just not accept that administrators aren’t rotten to their cores. Although Swensen is the highest paid employee on campus, the fact that he earns millions less than his counterparts at Harvard, Columbia and other prominent universities — with worse performing endowments — should attest to his devotion to the school and to a vision of a more accessible Yale.
In his rift with the News last week, Swensen unfortunately chose to levy his complaints against the school paper instead of student activists — whose so obviously misguided efforts he dismissed with little more than a shrug. It is the News, he argued, that deserves blame for not properly assessing the inaccurate claims of protesters.
Yet this argumentative framework led to a petty, unproductive debate on the ethics of investment and journalism. The students at the News volunteer countless hours every night to produce a full paper that, unlike the majority of other college papers, actually serves as the locus of most campus controversies, the Swensen debate included.
Claims that the News should have followed The New York Times’ publishing standards are absurd. Not only because the News doesn’t have nearly the same time, money and manpower as the Times, but also because the national paper isn’t exactly known itself for being unbiased. Writers take pains to insert a liberal bent in their reports, blending fact and fiction at the expense of any semblance of “objective” journalism.
That said, the News was wrong to publish Swensen’s piece as a full column in the first place. It should have run as a Letter to the Editor, with an accompanying editor’s note addressing the supposed factual inaccuracy. With apologies to Swensen and the News staff who dealt with the onslaught, at least take comfort knowing that many people welcomed the theatrics of the last few days as a much-needed break from midterms.
A better critique of our financial holdings by students would entail a detailed report of faculty hiring statistics versus administrative costs of overstaffing in such bureaucratic places as the Center for Teaching and Learning and in the overabundance of ambiguous deans’ offices. We should make sure the University is doing its job before rehashing ethical disputes that are likely antithetical to our progressive aspirations.
Meanwhile, I suggest that administrators should take a cue from the activists — “re-educate” the Yale population through a series of teach-ins. Teach us about the basics of endowment growth, what it means for Yale to spend money from donors or what the student income contribution really is. Make it as basic as possible and use plenty of “vibrant photos and precise figures.”
Oh, and better underline your title and put it in all caps. Then we’ll understand. I’m sure.
Although we’ve left the college application season behind us and Ivy Day stands only two weeks away, the war against the Common Application rages on.
Yesterday morning, the Education Committee of the Connecticut General Assembly convened a public hearing for arguments concerning RSB-359, a bill which would prohibit the disaggregation of student data by ethnic subgroups in the public school information system. The strong support it has received from Chinese-American Connecticut residents — among them parents and high school students — is only the latest in a series of protests by Asian-Americans against race-based data collection, which they perceive as a discriminatory burden in college admissions. Just last November, the Asian American Coalition for Education demanded that the Common Application remove its list of 10 options to designate an applicant’s “Asian background”; in August, Asian-American residents of Massachusetts protested a pro-disaggregation bill introduced by Massachusetts state Rep. Tackey Chan, calling it “racist.”
I am — as are, I’m sure, many other Asians at Yale — sympathetic to the fears and motives of the Chinese-Americans who have rallied behind this bill. Their misgivings toward the fact that “Asian” is the most specifically subdivided racial category on the Common App are not unfounded. Nor are their fears that disaggregation, hand in hand with affirmative action, might affect their children’s chances of gaining admission to top-tier colleges.
They are, however, misguided in their belief that disaggregation only serves as a mask for segregation. Under data aggregation, the differences that exist between Southeast Asians and East Asians, between immigrants and American-born Asians, would be obscured. The persistence of the “model minority” myth reflects the visibility long granted to East Asians — often those in the upper-middle class — in America that eclipses the presence and needs of other subgroups. The de facto erasure of financially disadvantaged subgroups — many of them Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander — would only amplify the racist tones of the model minority myth. The ability to clarify such information would aid not only in understanding demographic diversity, but also in applying more specialized and effective teaching methods in schools, such as remedial reading programs for immigrants or children of immigrants.
In fact, the arguments of those supporting RSB-359 — which addresses data collection only at the state level among public schools — reveals that they have entirely misunderstood disaggregation and overlooked its effects on primary and secondary education. The rush to oppose disaggregation for fear of racism in college admissions has trickled down into a refusal to identify ethnic subdivisions at all education levels. Somehow, they saw antagonism against Asian success underwritten into a bill intended to improve public education for all students.
But what is the point of such categories, anyway? If we’re attempting to capture nuances in political and racial identity, the assortment of labels offered by the Common App falls obviously, woefully short. My own ethnicity can be subdivided far more minutely than “Other East Asia” implies: as an immigrant, as Taiwanese — both of which gave me a very different upbringing than the one my American-born Chinese peers received — which undeniably complicates my “Taiwanese-American” identity, to say nothing of my Chinese or Chinese-American affiliations. In his book “A Chinaman’s Chance,” Eric Liu ’90 explains his refusal to hyphenate “Chinese American.” He entertains all possible combinations offered by English punctuation — Chinese (American), Chinese-American, Chinese/American — to illustrate the futility of communicating identity through labels but also the potency of what is preserved.
These labels, as dissatisfactory and impersonal as they are, represent a much-needed effort to resist misunderstanding and eliding all Asian-Americans. My background could not have made clearer to me the important differences within the “Asian-American” community — a label that I often find a misleading catch-all, loaded with assumptions of success and culturally ingrained aggression — that beg greater clarity.
The threat of misunderstanding race and diversity, nevertheless, looms large. The need for disaggregation points to huge knowledge gaps in the current iteration of affirmative action, or AA. Anti-AA groups have long adduced the policy’s failure in recruiting black Americans as evidence of its ineffectiveness; the “black” quota at Ivy Leagues tends to draw a majority of West Indian or African immigrants or biracial students, many of whom are financially better off than the average black American. The failure to specify all racial groups according to more precise criteria such as country of origin has allowed immigration patterns to stymie AA’s efforts to address black Americans. This failure might be alleviated, too, by expanding data disaggregation across all ethnic groups.
Although disaggregation might not fully dispel the model minority myth, it may at least weaken its hold on the American imagination. For Asian-Americans to reduce this to an issue of college acceptances admits only of myopia. We do not exist for ourselves alone, and it’s high time that we as Asian-Americans realized this, too, despite the unifying and insufficient label that we share.
Why in the world have the Yale College Democrats and the Yale Student Environmental Coalition, or YSEC, agreed to support a plan backed by Republican politicians and big oil companies? Both groups — in addition to the Yale College Republicans — are now co-founders of a coalition called Students for Carbon Dividends, or S4CD, which promotes a conservative climate solution. Beyond Yale, supporters of the same carbon dividends plan include George H.W. Bush’s chief of staff and ExxonMobil but also The Nature Conservancy, The New York Times and Stephen Hawking.
How did all of these people and organizations agree on the same thing? And why is YSEC on board? The first time I heard of the carbon dividends plan, I was looking for the catch. The idea of supporting anything endorsed by the fossil fuel industry was unthinkable. Now, I think S4CD is the most important work I do on campus. When implemented, the policy will reduce emissions by 28 percent below 2005 levels, nearly twice the expected decrease from current regulations according to a report by the Climate Leadership Council. I want to explain why it is important for YSEC, a traditionally nonpartisan umbrella organization, to back S4CD and in doing so create momentum for a breakthrough climate solution.
I think a lot about what YSEC does and who it represents, mostly so I know what to say when my friends confuse my group with YSECS, the Yale Society for Exploring Campus Secrets that probably pestered you during Bulldog Days. Here’s my typical response: YSEC works to foster a sense of community and common interest among student environmentalists and groups of all kinds at Yale and beyond.
Groups of all kinds. Now what does that mean, exactly? To me, it means that YSEC should give voice to students and groups of all interests and backgrounds, especially to those who are traditionally underrepresented. Our coalition group, Fossil Free Yale, does an amazing job of that, leading passionate students in organized action against environmental and social injustices perpetrated by Yale. However, there is one voice conspicuously missing from the climate change conversation on campus: young Republicans.
As a YSEC board member, my initial mistrust of S4CD was rooted in common misconception: that self-professed environmentalists are almost always politically left-of-center. However, according to a 2016 survey conducted by AGC Research, 85 percent of young conservatives believe the climate is changing, and 74 percent want to address climate change in a way that does not hurt the economy. So why haven’t they spoken up? Before now, Republicans had no way to vote for the planet without betraying their party. The environmental fixes offered by Democrats were also reliant on big government control and increasing regulation. S4CD embodies a new energy, offering a plan built on conservative values. I see YSEC’s support as a direct extension of our mission to unite all students who share an understanding of the threat environmental issues pose to political justice and economic prosperity.
S4CD’s launch is momentous because, for the first time, conservatives are uniting students of all political beliefs around an actionable plan. While co-authored by leaders of the Republican party, the carbon dividends plan is meant to be a consensus climate solution. The plan is based on four pillars: a gradually rising and revenue-neutral carbon tax; carbon dividend payments to all Americans, funded by 100 percent of the revenue; rollback of carbon regulations that are no longer necessary; and border carbon adjustments to level the playing field for workers and businesses.
Liberals and environmentalists can get excited about a tax on carbon that finally holds extractive capitalists accountable for emissions and gives money back to low-income Americans who are disproportionately impacted by climate change. On the other hand, conservatives can get excited because the plan relies on free-market principles, swaps out regulations for a price on carbon and puts pressure on other countries to meet an American standard.
Despite my instinctive hesitation to agree with anything that Shell, BP and ExxonMobil have signed on to, I see this plan as the best way to take swift, effective action against climate change. On the issue of climate change, the clock is running down, and I am willing to make unlikely allies if it means getting something done. Endorsing the carbon dividends plan is a decision I am proud to make, in order to help unite my generation over a critical global issue and bring about necessary, rapid change.
YSEC and the other co-founders of S4CD are launching a movement. Surrounded as we are by an intense atmosphere of political divisiveness, the carbon dividends plan is nothing short of groundbreaking — the first bipartisan plan to offer a realistic solution to climate change. Faced with an existential climate threat, we are ready to push for a solution that will actually win. S4CD gives me hope because it is going to get things done, and I urge you to believe in it as deeply as I do.
People in my friend’s history seminar think she is an authoritarian communist. Well, she doesn’t know for sure, but the looks she got must have meant something. The catalyst? Pointing out long-standing exploitation inherent in free markets — maybe a little too defensively — after several others offered creatively reworded versions of “Communism is bad according to the text and real life.” Shouldering this label until next class took quite a toll, especially because my friend isn’t particularly invested in evangelizing mass collectivization, which she, like most in the seminar, doesn’t endorse. Though no classmates jumped to hasty conclusions, it seemed as if some of them internally questioned whether or not my friend had, just a moment ago, weighed her view against historical unanimity and emerged agnostic to the deaths many states have caused. In fact, she isn’t a Marx apologist if you get to know her. Our political arguments usually wind up as aggressive agreement.
Imagine the same seminar with less misunderstanding; right before my friend launches into playing devil’s advocate, she announces that no, she isn’t ignoring the system’s well-documented pitfalls, and of course, she wouldn’t prefer the system that the text advocates over our current one. With the correct perfunctory disclaimers, no one feels the need to relay the otherwise “problematic” statements a classmate made in seminar. And here lies the tragedy.
We believe things should be a certain way. The way we treat others, the activism we undertake and even what we have for breakfast reflect that worldview. To convey that, we preface what we say to our peers. It’s not hard; if we first reconcile our worldview with the majority’s, the world of safe opinions opens to us. We do it to avoid our quote appearing on a provocative “Overheard at Yale” post or starring in someone else’s “you won’t believe what someone in section said today” story to their suitemate.
Cut through Cross Campus or walk up Prospect Street at 10:30 a.m. on a weekday, and the lion’s share of the crowd are strangers. But if Yale is truly a community of interesting people at the same place in life, we shouldn’t think of each other as such. Opinions at Yale run the gamut — left, right, 29 degrees diagonal, abolish the student income contribution, Morse and Ezra Stiles colleges have the best dining hall — but we all have one thing in common: membership in the Yale community. We are akin by default.
Does one’s membership in the Yale community indicate special open-mindedness or prejudice? I believe it’s the former. We should certainly continue to be careful that what we express does not cause harm out of malice or negligence. But in all else, share without expecting your sentiments in this moment to determine the impression that others have of you in perpetuity. Disagreement in an agreeable community takes after the familiarity of friendship. We can make jokes at our friends’ expense without losing their friendship, and we don’t need to append a “just kidding” for them to know we don’t mean it.
My second plea corresponds: Give each other the benefit of the doubt. If we don’t want onlookers to generalize statements we don’t qualify, then we shouldn’t do the same to others. A culture of accepting diverse ideas, which is critical to any university, needs to eliminate the false choice of either accommodating one’s view to the majority’s or risking the majority branding our process of thinking as unequivocally unacceptable just because one of our ideas runs against the grain. On deep controversies, I don’t know anyone whose scope of opinion only extends to the one sentence in question that they said. On simpler questions of someone’s human decency, there’s more to learn from spending time with them than judging them when they misspeak. We know individually that we don’t fit the stereotype of the easily offended special snowflake. It’s not a great leap to admit that others don’t fit that description either.
Yesterday, Saifullah Khan was acquitted of all charges of sexual assault. He had been charged with having sex with a woman who was too drunk to give consent. He claimed that the sex they had was consensual. Only afterward, he claims, did she rewrite the narrative of their encounter.
In light of this legal verdict, Khan’s lawyer said that Yale should readmit Khan after he was suspended in November 2015, three days before his arrest. The lawyer, Norm Pattis, said the University should “right that wrong” and welcome Khan back into the community.
Readmitting Khan would be a grievous mistake, as using legal standards of “not guilty” do not apply in a private community like Yale. Legal acquittal does not mean “innocence.” It does not mean that Khan did not engage in deeply dubious sexual conduct. It just means that a jury could not find that this sexual behavior was, to their eyes, rape beyond a reasonable doubt. Fortunately, a courtroom and a college community have different standards of proof. Here, the question is not, “Is this person absolutely guilty?” Instead, the question is more, “Has this person acted in such a way that their right to continued participation in our community is forfeit?”
To my eyes, the answer to the second question is, resoundingly, “Yes. His place here is forfeit.” Our University system requires a “preponderance of evidence” in the formal proceedings of the University-Wide Committee, which is our most trial-like approach to handling sexual misconduct and assault. A preponderance of evidence is the idea that, more likely than not, one person violated another.
There is certainly a preponderance of evidence that the sex that happened after the Halloween show in 2015 falls far outside the realm of appropriate. For unlike our legal system, Yale considers consent to be more than just “not rape.” Instead, Yale’s definition of consent is “positive, unambiguous and voluntary agreement to engage in specific sexual activity throughout a sexual encounter.”
The alleged victim threw up several times and had to leave the Halloween Show, thus demonstrating that she was too intoxicated to give consent that was unambiguous. She could not walk unaided. She could not use her key unaided. She threw up again after they returned to her room. They struggled in sex and she had bruises from the encounter the next day. To all reasonable eyes, this is a portrait of someone too drunk to give positive, unambiguous, voluntary and continued consent. And it does not measure up to standards of consent laid out by Yale in its bylaws.
This line of reasoning can often lead conservatives to argue inflated ideas of false accusations, claiming that women “cry rape” unjustly. This is bogus. It comes from inflated fears of vindictive women suffering from a certain type of modern hysteria. No person with the best sexual intentions would have sex with someone that drunk, and no person with the best sexual intentions would struggle with someone they are having sex with to the point of bruising. Men can easily avoid being accused of assault by simply not assaulting women or being in situations that are ambiguous. Women say they are raped when they experienced something that felt like a serious violation. They do not say that they were raped simply because they want to ruin someone’s day.
The sex described between Khan and the alleged victim represents a disturbing failure to recognize another person’s interiority and understand how one’s own actions impact the livelihood of other people. The fact that Khan continued to participate in and initiate sex shows, at the very minimum, critically bad judgment and an overwhelming selfishness. Individuals who approach sex — one of the most vulnerable and intimate things we do — with such cavalier malice should be unwelcome at Yale.
Furthermore, it is unacceptable at Yale to put alleged victims on trial rather than alleged rapists, as the defense attempted to do. Khan’s lawyers commented on her Halloween costume and asked why she had not been dressed more modestly. After the trial, they dismissed this interaction as an “experiment.” This is a semi-eloquent version of “she was asking for it,” a misogynistic tactic that men habitually use to silence women who have experienced sexual violence by blaming them for their own assaults. The clothes women choose to wear are never invitations for assault, and rape is never a sexual experiment gone awry.
This problem extends far beyond the bounds of this one man or this one night. Just because the courts have found this example of sexual misconduct one in which the participant was “not guilty” does not mean it is acceptable or that Khan is innocent. He is not. And he — along with everyone else found to have a preponderance of evidence of sexual misconduct — should not be allowed back on our campus.
It has been recently argued in the News that to criticize stridency and passionate argument in the classroom is to criticize a uniquely Jewish mode of argument. It is undoubtedly true that the Jewish conversational standards I was raised with are at odds with Yale’s WASP-y norms of politeness. In Jewish spaces, I interrupt and am interrupted, jumping to poke holes in weak arguments. This is a different way of communicating than the patient, wait-your-turn conversations we have in section and over meals, and we should turn a critical eye to where those norms come from. However, to limit the understanding of what “Talmudic” debate is to aggressive argumentation is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of Jewish conversation.
The locus for the interrupting argumentation that is so characteristically Jewish is Talmud study, which is traditionally done in pairs called “chavruta.” When I study with a chavruta, we often yell and interrupt in our attempt to understand the sparse and confusing text of the ancient document, as Jews have done for thousands of years. Talmud is traditionally studied in a “beit midrash,” a study hall, which is characterized by its hubbub, the sounds of many voices animatedly — and often aggressively — seeking meaning. What differentiates chavruta from discussion section, though, is relationship.
“Chavruta” describes not merely a mode of study but the relationship in which it is instantiated. “She’s my chavruta” is a sentence that implies a deep and sustained friendship; people sometimes study with the same chavruta for most of their lives. What makes it possible for me to yell at my chavruta when we study is our underlying friendship, her awareness that my aggression is about the text and not about her and my own trust that she will not read my challenges as a reflection of a belligerent or rude character. Without these factors, a chavruta session is just shouting.
The Talmud itself reflects on the way in which a chavruta relationship can be shattered. In tractate Bava Metzia, we encounter the origin story of Rabbi Yohanan and Reish Lakish, a chavruta whose disputes are recorded on thousands of Talmudic pages. Rabbi Yohanan, a scholar, convinces the highwayman Reish Lakish to turn away from his banditry and instead use his “strength for Torah study.” Rabbi Yohanan takes on Reish Lakish as a student, and as he grows in knowledge, he becomes Rabbi Yohanan’s chavruta.
One day, there is a debate in the beit midrash about the manufacturing process of swords. Rabbi Yohanan argues one position, while Reish Lakish asserts another. Rabbi Yohanan insultingly responds by telling Reish Lakish that “a bandit knows his banditry,” conceding the argument by invoking Reish Lakish’s past life of violence. The two men quarrel, and Reish Lakish falls ill as a result and dies.
Rabbi Yohanan is deeply saddened, and his rabbinic colleagues send him a bright young rabbi as a replacement. For every ruling that Rabbi Yohanan makes, the student provides a prooftext to support him. Rabbi Yohanan grows upset; he says, “In my discussions with the son of Lakish, when I would state a matter, he would raise twenty-four difficulties against me in an attempt to disprove my claim, and I would answer him with twenty-four answers, and the Law would become broadened and clarified. And yet you say to me: There is a ruling which supports your opinion. Do I not know that what I say is good?” Rabbi Yohanan grows so distressed that he walks the streets wailing for his lost chavruta, and eventually dies.
This story illustrates the strengths and pitfalls of an argumentative discourse. In mourning Reish Lakish, Rabbi Yohanan illuminates that the ideal chavruta is one who challenges: Knowledge can only emerge from confrontation and dispute. However, the tragedy of this story is the decay of the relationship that enabled that dispute. By insulting Reish Lakish, reminding him that he did not originally belong in the space of the beit midrash, Rabbi Yohanan destroys the relationship that allowed for such knowledge to grow.
For “Talmudic” argumentation to work, it must be built on a strong foundation of trust and respect, one where all parties feel that they have a right to the space. This mode of discourse can be profoundly intellectually generative and meaningful. However, to advocate for it at Yale must also be to advocate for a stronger Yale community. We can only yell at each other in class when we know that we will eat lunch together afterwards. We can only have a robust argumentative culture when everyone knows they have equal space and credibility, regardless of gender, race or the other factors that filter how we see aggression and intellect.
We should uplift Jewish modes of conversation at Yale. At the center of that is to treat our peers with respect and good faith, to build bonds of affection and trust. Come study Talmud with me; you’ll see.
Yale Students for Prison Divestment prides itself on the accuracy and rigor of its research.  Yale remains invested in the for-profit prison industry overseas and has made no formal commitment to avoid future investment in domestic for-profit prisons. As such, we would like to contest recent arguments made by Chief Investment Officer David Swensen.
We should note that Swensen is correct in saying that Vanguard’s FTSE Emerging Markets Exchange-Traded Fund (VWO) does not contain holdings in either GEO Group Inc. or CoreCivic, the two largest operators of for-profit prison facilities in the U.S. according to an article published by Boston’s NPR news station. We apologize for this mistake and do not take it lightly.
Yet Swensen himself isn’t giving readers the full picture when he argues that Yale’s endowment has no exposure to private prison companies. As of Sept. 30, 2017, Yale’s Form 13F on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website reported $66 million holdings in BlackRock’s iShares MSCI EAFE Exchange-Traded Fund (EFA). He argues that, because the fund focuses on markets outside the U.S. and Canada, it has no exposure to the for-profit prison industry. This is incorrect. The holdings of Blackrock’s EFA, as made available for the public on Blackrock’s website, include firms like Sodexo and G4S, both of which operate for-profit prisons around the world. In particular, G4S is an international private security firm that has operated a number of private youth detention centers and provides security services along the U.S.-Mexico border as cited by Bloomberg government. Sodexo operates 122 prisons worldwide as of 2017 according to Anthea Hucklesby and Stuart Lister’s “The Private Sector and Criminal Justice.” As growth rates of U.S. incarceration have slowed, for-profit private prison companies have diversified their assets and have expanded their presence in international markets. Although the industry began in the U.S., today private prisons are run by multinational corporations with international and domestic holdings. Thus, simple exposure to international markets does not reduce exposure to the for-profit prison industry.
This exchange between Yale student advocates and Swensen highlights the need for improved channels of communication with the Yale administration. Yale’s annual reports on the endowment detail broad categories of investment, but not specific firms. We would not presume that Yale’s fund managers release the specifics of a highly watched endowment portfolio. However, we would welcome the opportunity for open dialogue with Swensen. For two years, YSPD has worked hard to engage with the official channels provided by the Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility. These channels explicitly prevent direct engagement with the Yale Corporation and, in practice, make it nearly impossible to communicate with the Yale Investments Office decision-makers.
For the first time Swensen has claimed on the record that Yale isn’t invested in private prisons. This is welcome news, but inadequate. YSPD maintains that a commitment to divestment is more than an individual statement about current holdings — instead, divestment is a broad moral gesture that disavows for-profit incarceration as an exploitative industry that disproportionately affects poor communities of color.
A statement condemning the for-profit prison industry would explicitly refuse future investments. Yale should follow the precedent of a number of peer institutions including Columbia University and UC Davis in affirmatively and unequivocally rejecting future investment in the for-profit prison industry. Moreover, Yale’s history of divestment from companies in Apartheid South Africa provides grounds for divestment from the for-profit prison industry given that currently the U.S. imprisons black citizens at a higher rate than the South African government did at the height of Apartheid, according to Michelle Alexander’s “The New Jim Crow.”
Swensen has suggested that for-profit prisons might not warrant divestment. Yet we argue that exchanging human liberty for profit is, perhaps, the gravest social injury. For-profit prisons have heavily lobbied to criminalize immigration, promote harsher sentencing laws and develop contracts free from government oversight. For-profit prison contracts reduce quality of service to cut costs and sustain a profit-driven model of human detention and incarceration. This trend was demonstrated powerfully in an academic paper by Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmström, which received the 2016 Nobel Prize in economics. Other journalists, academics and non-profits have documented numerous abuses in for-profit prisons including medical negligence, sexual assault and preventable death.
But, in a way, even questions about comparative differences between public and private prisons are both immaterial and distracting. Yale, as a private investor, cannot invest in the public management of prisons. However, Yale can, and does, invest in for-profit management . Therefore, we have a unique responsibility to challenge investments in for-profit prisons. That for-profit prisons wield outsized political power to extend the legacy of slavery and restrict immigrants’ access to basic human rights, means we have a unique responsibility to set the tone for what is considered ethical investment, just as we have a responsibility to stand against xenophobic immigration policies. That Yale has an endowment greater than the GDP of many countries means that our positions, models and leadership matter. Nothing about our critique is personal, rather it is an attempt to hold Yale, its leaders, students, faculty and investments to the highest ethical standard.

Editor’s note, March 7: A footnote in David Swensen’s March 1 column, “The endowment & the activists,” which addresses this issue but was originally omitted because the News does not publish footnotes, is printed here:
“Even if the activists made factually correct arguments about shares held through index funds (VWO and EFA are index funds used by Yale for daily rebalancing activities), there is a vast difference between purposeful direct investment in an individual company’s shares and passive indirect exposure to shares in a broad-based index fund. The former deserves ethical scrutiny. The latter does not.”
The “Editors’ Note: Responding to criticism,” which appeared in the March 4 edition of the Yale Daily News, continues an unfortunate exchange between me and the editors of the News.
My op-ed piece of March 1 was submitted to the News under the header of “ONLY TO BE PRINTED WITHOUT EDITING,” which was written with all capital letters and underlined.
The piece was printed by the News with two edits (even though the editors only admit to one), removal of a sentence and removal of a footnote. I was astonished and angry. The questions “Don’t you understand simple English?” and “What is the matter with you?” came to mind after the unauthorized printing of my op-ed, as did the adjectives “disgusting” and “inexcusable.” In the original Editor’s Note of March 1, the editor failed to acknowledge that the News violated my requirement that the op-ed piece not be edited. I described that omission as “cowardly,” important context that the March 4 Editors’ Note failed to provide. I apologize for the intemperate language. I stand firm in my profound unhappiness with the News.
In the re-published version of my op-ed, the Editor added the deleted sentence dealing with contact between a reporter and my office and failed to add the deleted footnote. I did not give permission for re-publication. By adding the sentence, the Editor created a “gotcha” moment, which she exploited in the March 1 Editor’s Note, leading to further frustration and the News’ escalation of their attack on my credibility and tone.
Had the News contacted me to discuss the question of the reporter’s contact with my office, we could have resolved the issue amicably (in the same way we resolved an earlier issue regarding word count). The fact is that the reporter did not contact my office for fact checks or context. She simply provided a Sunday evening heads up that she was writing a story about the activist presentation, which would appear the next morning. In other words, the contact was not substantial.
The March 4 Editors’ Note has a link to a collection of email messages between me and Editor in Chief Rachel Treisman. The emails, which contain the quotes cited above, were printed without my permission. I would not have granted permission if asked (I was not asked), because it was an informal exchange, clearly not written for publication. I question the ethics of the decision to publish without my permission.
Yale’s Endowment provides foundational support for the University, accounting for more than 60 percent of revenues for Yale College and the Graduate and Professional Schools (excluding the School of Medicine, which relies on grants, contracts and clinical revenues with only a modest level of Endowment income). Distributions from Endowment provide across-the-board support for every aspect of life at Yale.
I have devoted my career to serving Yale. I love this University, particularly its students, which is why in addition to managing Yale’s endowment, I teach and mentor whenever I have the opportunity. The one aspect of the growth in endowment resources of which I am most proud is the fact that Yale College is one of a handful of institutions that is need-blind globally.
The ability to say to any applicant, anywhere, that if you qualify for admission, you can afford to come, makes us a stronger, better place. I hope that strengthening Yale, one of the world’s truly great institutions, will be my legacy.

Editor’s note: The News does not typically engage in “do not edit” agreements, a position we will reinforce moving forward, as we fact check every column we publish and considered this case no exception. Still, we understand Swensen’s frustration and will strive to make our policies clearer in the future. 
Before I left for my year abroad, I remember being terrified of the world — Yale — going on without me. I remember worrying that I would be forgotten by my friends. I remember how much it comforted me when people said “Don’t worry, it’ll be like nothing has changed when you get back.”
It was odd. I hated so many parts of Yale — the hyper-competitiveness masquerading as effortless nonchalance, the networking and constant introspection of why so-and-so didn’t want you, subtle judgement across race and class and even your goddamn major. I wanted it all to change, but at the same time I selfishly wanted nothing to change at all.
A part of me expected to lose my friends. Like a seed of dread planted deep, easily ignored. So I told myself that if I lost them all it was probably a net positive in the end, because that meant we shouldn’t be friends anyways. Right? Because if we can’t go a year of long-distance friendship, a lifetime of it is sort of off the table.
But damn, that logic is hard to follow when it’s happening.
I remember feeling this faint hurt thrumming in my heart at first. Subtle. I would check Snapchat — a classic millennial — and see my suitemates laughing in the corner of somebody’s story. I would see my a cappella group-chat light up with an update about what room rehearsal was in. It was an ache at first, knowing they were not only able to do all the things without you, they were able to be happy as well. Isn’t it cruel to feel hurt that your friends are happy?
The pain was all sharp edges and I was soft skin and half-swallowed words. But as my messages began to go unanswered, I remember being frustrated, then angry. Is there a difference between a “bad texter” and somebody who just doesn’t care enough?
I felt like I was going through this vast emotional change — this change where I was learning to be alone and find pockets of adventure and happiness in a busy day, where I was finally grasping onto Chinese culture and learning to stop caring about what others thought of me. And I wanted my friends to be a part of it with me.
But they weren’t. So I tried to tell myself that these people were probably never good friends anyways. That it was just a matter of time. It was a hostile combination of buried anger and feigned indifference.
But as my time abroad began to quicken in pace, the anger trickled away. I realized that just because you’re no longer friends doesn’t always take away from the authenticity of that friendship. That there can be different times in your life for different people.
Someone told me that I probably just felt disconnected because I wasn’t there, that it would return to normal when I got back. But these same words that had comforted me so, just months ago, no longer did. Because I like my new normal. And it was okay if things were no longer the same, it was okay if these friendships were perhaps not what they were before.
There are some memories of the friendship, the physical, that are outwardly permanent. The scar on my palm from falling, tipsy and laughing with friends on York St., is still there. Black hair dye on my white T-shirt when I dramatically swore to change, it’s still there.
But the others are permanent too. The hoarse voices from singing badly, and much too loudly on Cross Campus at 2 a.m. The frustration, teeming with anger, as you ranted about how you’d thought Yale would be better, the students less judgmental, less mean. The subsequent slouched shoulders and cursing at “the system” and weak giggling. These are all still there. They are real.
But it’s all right if they don’t continue the way you always expected them to. And it doesn’t mean the hushed voices and brimming tears and breaking laughter were less real.
Maybe we should stop being so afraid of things happening when we’re not there and instead hope that things are. We say it is others we fear will change but a little part of that is a fear that we ourselves will change.
I’ve lost most of my friends. Unsurprisingly, the ones I would “grab a meal with” whenever the time since our last one stretched awkwardly too long. But also the ones who assured me that things would stay the same. The ones that hugged me and said our friendship wouldn’t change.
But I am glad.
Not some sinister sort of happiness coupled with bitterness. Nor is it masquerading as cool indifference or vice versa.
For once, it is ok. I left and am coming back someone different. I think they are doing the same.
I want to miss out. Because that means I’m present in something else. And that something else will be amazing.

Why, oh why, oh why why why do we so rarely hear country music at Spring Fling?
Amidst the uproar caused by the controversial lyrics in Spring Fling 2018’s current line up, I think that we have forgotten to ask a very important question: Where has all the country music gone? As a proud member of the under-represented group of people who really do like a little country music every now and again, I am truly saddened by its obvious absence in this year’s lineup. I was truly saddened last year too, when I received a nasty shock towards the end of the evening: I was head-bobbing along, awkwardly, to some indiscernible lyrics and some hefty bass when my friend — one who shares some, though not all of my tastes in music — informed me that this was the final song and that there would be, after all was said and done, no country music.
I knew then that I would dance no more.
This was no small concession to make. You see, for me, to stop dancing was to stop moving. My night, as any melodramatic main character in any cliché movie might have yowled, was ruined. Once I knew that “You look like I need a drink” by Justin Moore wouldn’t be played — which was, incidentally, the theme song of my first year — I was done. No more for me was the after-party, no more for me the post-Fling celebration; no more for me the sweet sweet taste of the anticipation of Elysium.
Throughout the day, I had been waiting for just one song. I didn’t particularly care which song, just a song. A special sort of song. A song that would rock my soul in the finely tuned arms of a beloved guitar. Maybe for some the hard pounding of rap or trap — or maybe ASAP? — could do that. Maybe some other genre of music or lack-of-genre music could make their hearts flutter with love for the notes in the air. But as for me — and I am not alone — country music was meant to be the key. It was the key that would finally unlock the potential of Spring Fling.
Saying that makes me wonder what the true potential of Spring Fling actually is. Supposedly, it brings together the Yale community, uniting us all with the beauty of the language we all have in common: music. Supposedly, we will all dance away the afternoon and in doing so somehow feel closer. This works, literally. I definitely became much better acquainted with the swath of unidentifiable bodies — I am short — gyrating to the left of me, gyrating to the right of me, as the music, in Tennyson’s surprisingly apt words, “volleyed and thundered”. I don’t, however, think that that brought me meaningfully closer to any member of the Yale community.
Maybe I am alone in this, but I have learnt, since being at Yale, that it is important to speak up and speak out, because maybe there is someone out there who feels the same as I do. If swear words and sexual innuendos in a song are what make you happy, then I am glad, for your sake, because you have a community — or at least, at Spring Fling, you will find people who might understand you.
But I like blue jeans and daydreams and a little bit of swing. And, right at the heart of the music festival that has the potential to bring us together in a way fireside chats never could, I stand alone. Last year I tried to join in, I tried to make sense of the world of heavy metal and breathy notes; this year, I shall not.
In the name of inclusivity, in the spirit of diversity, for all those who dare not proclaim their love for a little lilt, I beg you to consider my gentle plea: Is one country song too much to ask?
After every tragedy, political reformers seek to harness the emotional energy of the moment to push their legislative agenda. Typically, this consists of accusing those opposed to their reforms of being responsible for the tragedy in order to sway the undecideds. This grandstanding technique allows them to deflect any attempts at reason with emotional denunciations. Unfortunately, it deflects from actual substantive discussion that could result in positive reform.
This strategy has been on full display in the aftermath of the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida. At CNN’s town hall discussion between Stoneman Douglas High School students, local residents, Florida politicians and National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch, the students were frequently used as a political barrier to substantive debate. Any attempts by Ms. Loesch or Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., at discussing moderate reforms that could have aided in the prevention of the shooting were met with accusations of moral responsibility for the shooting itself.
Those affected by the shooting are understandably distraught, and this is why many have argued that the debate on gun control should not take place while emotions are high. This is not a desire to sweep the issue under the rug, but a recognition that discussion on such an important subject should not take place without rational thought. I implore you to watch the town hall and news coverage of the debate, with the NRA being called “child murderers” and audience members screaming insults at Sen. Rubio and Loesch, and consider whether this is truly a productive political atmosphere for debate to take place. The framing of the dialogue changes from “What measures could prevent future tragedies?” to “If you don’t support a ban on assault weapons, then you’re responsible for the deaths of those children.” Those kinds of false equivalencies certainly get a rise out of an audience, but they erroneously equate owning a firearm with killing children.
This tactic is certainly not limited to those on the left. Last October, an ISIS-inspired 27-year-old man purposefully drove a rented truck down a New York bike path, killing eight and injuring twelve. President Donald Trump responded to the attack by calling for an end to the visa lottery through which the man had gained his citizenship. However, an evil act by one man out of the 50,000 people given green cards through the program yearly does not, on its own, justify the end of the program. Unfortunately, this did not stop it from becoming a rallying cry on the right.
It is absurd to pretend that nothing short of an assault weapon ban could have prevented the shooting in Florida. The shooter had a long history of mental illness and violent behavior. His threats of violence would qualify as assault, a felony, or he could have been involuntarily hospitalized and psychologically evaluated through the Baker Act. As Loesch put it, “None of us support people who are crazy, … who are a danger to others getting their hands on a firearm.” If the goal is actually “common sense gun reform,” then it makes little sense to target the millions of law-abiding firearm owners, when laws in place could have prevented the situation.
Responsible gun owners have already been advocating for federally mandated reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and would be more than willing to support legislation to ensure those that display violent behavior are restricted from purchasing weapons. However, when politicians condescendingly say, “Nobody wants to take your guns,” while simultaneously advocating for an assault weapon ban — The Economist found that 73 percent of Democrats support a ban on semiautomatic rifles — any hope for cooperation becomes lost to fear that it will turn into a loss of the right to self-defense. The expiration of a federal ban of assault weapons in 2004 had no effect on murder rates. Additionally, from 2010 to 2014, rifles were used in slightly over 2 percent of all murders, outpaced doubly each year by hands, fists and feet, according to the FBI. However, the media’s obsession with mass shootings and campaigns based upon fear have painted assault weapons as a leading cause of violent crime.
This is why, unlike many of my classmates at Yale, I cannot support movements like the “March for Our Lives” that use scare tactics to push overreaching legislation. Their lack of specificity and depth on the issues, besides vaguely asking for “a comprehensive and effective bill” indicates that they either do not know what that bill would contain or they know that their idea of a “comprehensive and effective bill” would dissuade others from joining their cause. If you wish to bring about effective change, then educate yourself about firearms and engage in discussions about reform with those who support the right to bear arms. But if grandstanding and emotional appeals are more your style, have fun at the march and make sure to get a good photo for Instagram.
Had Yale’s Chief Investment Officer, David Swensen, attended our Feb. 3 teach-in on Endowment Justice, he would know that the event was about Yale’s extreme accumulation of wealth and the logics that give thrust to its mechanisms. It was about framing Yale’s endowment historically, acknowledging that Yale’s first professorship was endowed by a slaveholder and understanding that those tenets of greed and white supremacy continue to characterize its architectures. It presented some of Yale’s most pernicious investments and featured New Haven residents who spoke about how the University not only fails to invest, but in many ways causes harm in our city.
It is clear from Swensen’s criticisms that he was briefed on the event and studied our slides. That makes it surprising that he could so fully miss the point. He fails to engage with the meta-analyses we proposed, implying that we made hasty generalizations from insufficient evidence. We care immensely about precision and factual accuracy. Swensen’s statements have attempted to distract the Yale community from the injustices that the wealth-hoarding of our endowment perpetuates. Swensen, who made $4.2 million in 2015 as reported by Bloomberg and the News, would have people forget that — according to a 2016 University document — Yale spends between 4 and 6.5 percent of the endowment’s market value annually while producing a 6.6 percent per annum return for the ten year period ending in June 2017. In 2015, it paid fund managers $480 million but devoted less than $170 million to tuition assistance, according to research cited in a USA Today article that same year. We calculate that spending 1.3 percent of the total endowment would eliminate tuition, and that spending 2 percent of the total endowment would cover New Haven’s entire annual budget.
Swensen’s silence toward the information we presented on many of Yale’s investments amounts to a tacit acknowledgement of its accuracy. We presented on the $678 million we know Yale invests in the fossil industry — this is only what’s found on public tax forms; since most of Yale’s investments aren’t divulged publicly, Yale’s total investment in fossil fuels might be much more. Swensen doesn’t want to address that: He has attempted to make a public face for Yale as a climate-conscious investor.
He doesn’t deny the University’s history of profiting off debt crises of distressed economies. Maybe he wants to deflect attention from the quiet sale of Puerto Rican debt by one of Yale’s fund managers after activists critiqued the University for its holdings, and he wants to stymie conversation about possible continued investments in Puerto Rico’s debt. He doesn’t challenge facts we presented about Yale’s ownership of a forest and shadow company that, if approved, would’ve enabled a power line to decimate Pessamit lands in Quebec. He doesn’t even mention the other investments we described, including predatory payday loans, student loans and subprime mortgage companies.
As Swensen endeavors to infantilize activists and discredit student reporters, he reinforces the patriarchal and white supremacist idea of finance as an objective vocabulary wielded by a select few. As we stated at the teach in: We interrogate the language of finance and the endowment because we sense that this discourse and expertise invisibilizes certain peoples and the violence enacted against them in the name of profit.
We are told a fiction: that Yale can only provide a quality education if it continues investing the way it does now. We’re told that students would have to sacrifice if Yale removed its money from industries that propagate racism, generate inequality and destroy the planet and invested instead in sustainable solutions and local communities. This myth similarly justifies the continued existence of the student income contribution. The story of scarcity belies Yale’s $27.2 billion endowment.
We should be talking about how Yale could use its massive endowment to stay accountable to its city, influence and history. Yale could divest from subprime mortgage companies that foreclose on New Haven residents. It could employ many more New Haven workers at the University and hospital. The New Haven public school system currently has a budget shortfall of $10 million and is proposing firing teachers and closing schools; Yale could cover that deficit with hardly more than a day of the endowment’s profits. Instead, it continues to enjoy nonprofit status while effectively acting as a for-profit hedge fund, undermining New Haven’s tax base.
We are commanded to apologize for our critique because the machinery of finance — which, we do not deny, our fund managers so impeccably wield — is ostensibly for “us”: Yale students, the elite, gilded few. We are commanded to clasp our hands in unquestioning praise of the endowment’s financial eminence and to blithely ignore its reliance on tenets of inequality, exploitation and the growing untenability of life on Earth. But what if our families are directly impacted? What if some of us dream of creating a sustainable and just world? What if some of us dream of redistribution, reparations? What if we do not want blood money?
There’s a Dr. Seuss book on my shelf, gifted by a teacher when I graduated high school. “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” the cover exclaims in bright font, encapsulating the feeling I had when I first arrived at Yale. It was a feeling of possibility, that Yale would open countless doors as I climbed the ladder for me and my family. Education is the classic vessel of success for those on the path to “making it.” I had everything to gain.
Now, nearing the halfway point of Yale, I’m as aspirational as ever. Yet unlike my naive first year self, I’ve also realized how much I have to lose. I’ve struggled to navigate the hidden transaction that takes place with every opportunity I claim, where each step forward brings me further from my roots. The daily exchange of old world for new is not just my college experience: As the child of immigrants, I experience Yale as a scene in a multigenerational story of moving from home that began oceans away. It’s a story as much about cultural redefinition as it is about economic mobility.
Especially since I’ve started taking Chinese here, I’ve reflected about the values and logic I carry into any room from my culture. The Yale vocabulary and ways of thinking I’ve gained feel alternately empowering and alienating, the individualistic values championed here pull me toward a promising career yet directly opposite from the traditions and interdependent thinking that characterize home. Although my success plays into my parents’ narrative the same way Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim’s halfpipe gold has fed media attention surrounding her father, it also comes at the price of a double bind faced by immigrants: You have to be American enough to be successful, though only by being successful will you be acknowledged as truly American.
Society christens us with the gold-star sticker of the American dream when we fulfill a very specific rubric, often accompanied by commentary on our “work ethic” or justified by the high number of Fortune 500 company founders whose parents moved here. Indeed, Yalies, both professors and students, often speak about immigrants in economic terms, justifying a person’s access to basic human rights through their labor and contributions. We often define the dream in terms of value added, either attained through a person’s work or their children’s. Cultural dilution is a rarely recognized sacrifice, seen as a necessary part of ascension into American identity.
However, this is a far cry from the original idea. Venezuelan-American James Adams, who earned his master’s degree from Yale in 1900, coined the term “American dream” as dreaming not of “merely material plenty” but of a societal, moral value ensuring each person was “recognized for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.” America’s biggest contribution to the world, Adams claimed, was not capital progress, but this beautiful idea of a society that gives anyone — truly, anyone — the opportunity to attain a fuller life. America’s magic lies in the incredible things we do simply by having this mix of people from everywhere and every background. There’s nothing that makes America special if we claim we can achieve economic success with high-skilled immigrants — any country can do that.
In a world of starkly increasing inequality and divisiveness, it often feels like Adams’ vision of the American dream is hopeless. And on a practical level, there are limits to how many people can realistically live in any country. But rhetoric matters, especially when the current economic characterization of immigrant families implicitly supports inhumane decisions, such as the recent Supreme Court ruling that any immigrant can be indefinitely detained, even asylum-seekers and those with permanent legal status.
The current dialogue about immigration nationwide and on campus puts incredibly high pressure on immigrant families, especially immigrants of color, to prove economic worth and abandon parts of our cultures in pursuit of cookie-cutter success. I hope we think harder about which American dream we champion, so that Adams’ idea is not a dream deferred but a dream we fight for. It’s the first step toward a world where anyone can be American, and where any American has amazing places to go without having to sacrifice where they came from.

False dichotomies and double standards get us nowhere.
It’s no secret that Cupcakke is a controversial artist due to the sexually explicit content in her songs, and this kind of content makes many uncomfortable. Some people are therefore disappointed that Cupcakke will be performing during Spring Fling this year. However, to me, and to so many other Yalies, this very performance will prove come April that we have progressed immensely as a campus and in the larger context of society.
The first double standard against Cupcakke that I want to point out is that the same people who have publicly come out against her have turned a blind eye to A$AP Ferg, who will also be performing, rapping the words “suck a n—- d— or somethin’” multiple times in a row in one of his most famous songs, “Plain Jane.” Suddenly, when a woman includes explicit content in her speech, lyrics or any other form of self-expression, sirens go off. The sexism is clear, and it essentially comes down to slut-shaming. (By the way, Ferg, no hate — I’m a fan of yours too.)
Cupcakke’s lyrics contain content that is not only sexually explicit but also taboo, which adds to the shock value. It’s unfortunately easy to confuse rough sexual activity with sexual violence. However, there is a clear line between the two: consent. Normal, “vanilla” sex without consent is still sexual assault. One of the biggest issues with rape culture is that the word “rape” implies being brutally violated and pushed around. It’s one of the things that prevents victims from coming forward; they do not think that their trauma is valid based on these misconceptions.
It is also common for men to denounce women for participating in rough sexual activity, stripping them of the word “feminist” and claiming that they are subjecting themselves to objectification. This is essentially a glorified version of saying, “She was asking for it. She secretly liked it.” When women defend themselves, they are often told, “Don’t take it the wrong way! I’m just trying to be a feminist for you.” (Yes, I have actually been told this before. Mansplain much?)
Things get especially tricky for Cupcakke because she is a black woman, and we are often portrayed as animalistic and promiscuous. For this reason alone, black women in particular must be allowed to express their sexuality, whether it’s SZA lamenting about a guy texting her when he should know better or Cupcakke rapping about what she and her man did last night. Let us not make the argument that one is a “good” example of black representation at Yale and one is a “bad” example. There is no “right” way to be black.
Some have voiced their concern that Cupcakke’s selection to perform at Spring Fling undermines efforts to make campus more sexually safe. To this, I respond, with safety comes liberation. Being allowed to express one’s sexuality is part of what keeps us all safe, and it is not a man’s place to decide what is degrading to women. It is not anyone’s obligation to listen to Cupcakke’s music, but it is a right to express sexual confidence, even if that person is a woman — especially if that person is a woman. And it is the right thing to do to respect that.
Part of being a feminist, in fact, is supporting women regardless of their preferences. Imposing rules and judgment only adds weight to the ball and chain that women are already oppressed by. I have learned that in this world, no matter what a woman does, she will be ridiculed. Shouldn’t women at the very least be allowed the small privilege of expressing ourselves, even if that means that we will get backlash? Do we not deserve that, if not so much more?
Lastly, having Cupcakke perform at Yale is immensely meaningful to much of the LGBTQ+ community here. Cupcakke is one of few rappers to celebrate us without objectifying us (a la “Girls kissing girls, ’cause it’s hot, right?” — a line from Kanye West’s “Don’t Like”). In her video for “LGBT,” she is shown with people of all colors and sizes dancing, smiling and celebrating pride. What better way to represent our diverse and brilliant community than the queen herself?
This, in essence, is what Cupcakke is all about: taking ownership of whatever, whomever and however you love, as long as it’s consensual. So let’s all take a note from her. Yale, let’s go off this Spring Fling. Forget about the guy who won’t text you back, the finals looming ahead or any other haters coming your way. As Cupcakke would say, “Fresh air goin’ through my hair, I don’t care b—-, I’m just ridin’.”
I hate texting. There are days when I’d rather talk in front of 200 people than text one. Texting seems uniquely designed to prey on every insecurity that I might have.
I stare at the name of someone whom I met recently or that friend I’d lost touch with. After repeatedly convincing myself that any stammering message I attempted to relay would not be met with rolling eyes (too busy curing cancer to reply), I finally broach a conversation.
It’s then that I confront the empty chat bubble daring me to be clever. My procrastination-driving perfectionism kicks in: Too long and my text will be met with yawns. Too short, and it might not be English. Send.
Now the worst part kicks in: the wait. I’d make a terrible internet troll because in my personal social interactions, I desperately crave visual cues on the actual reactions of those I’m talking to. Trying to tabulate how long I should wait to text someone back in order to prove that I am just as busy as they are doesn’t appeal to me. And it feels awkward to make “appointments” with people just to hang out.
This makes me miss the days of high school, when the entire social scene revolved around one central space (for us, the library where nobody read), where you could just go, sit down and speak spontaneously with whomever was there. Not everything needed a plan; not everything required a yes or no response. Not everything involved an evaluation.
When I first got to Yale, a student advised me to treasure that first week, when you could just sit down at anybody’s table and make new friends. But the implicit catch was that these impromptu interactions were only going to last one week; after that, if I wanted to talk to people, every outing required a plan.
But that just didn’t match the community I saw around me at school. Every trip home I always came back with two things: a giant bag of laundry and a few proclamations on how open and inclusive the Yale community was, how you could approach anybody anytime and get an engaged answer.
And yet I wasn’t approaching many people; I wanted people to approach me. I was convinced, despite what I saw, that everyone wanted to only hear from names already within their social lexicons. People here were just too busy for me unless I made that “appointment,” and God knows I wasn’t going to be texting people.
Except these past couple weeks, I HAVE been texting people. I’ve been getting coffee (which I don’t drink) and setting up all of my meals. I’ve been scheduling time with people I’ve talked to frequently and people I’m only just getting to know. I feel happier.
But why have I been able to do this? Because I’ve been actively changing my internal narrative, constantly affirming to myself that everybody wants to talk to me. Always.
I don’t care if it’s true because it will be soon. No matter how curt the text responses are, no matter how long the wait between blue bubbles, no matter how difficult it is to line up our schedules, everybody wants to talk to me.
And when it feels like I’m the only one who’s reaching out, what brings comfort is remembering that everyone else, like me, always wants to be on the receiving end of an invite. It’s my place to extend the welcome — as much as I hate it — because that’s just my personality, and everyone still wants to talk to me.
Of course, this mindset doesn’t extend to outright rejections or when someone you know is angry with you and the situation requires more tact. Self-awareness is important. But for those moments when the world around you seems to be running without you, take a moment to tell yourself that despite the hecticness, everyone still wants to talk to you.
It feels like every student here has at one point decried how campus culture is centered on achievement and tight schedules. Every student has complained that people need to be doing less. Every student has internally wished that their friends made more time for them. That’s not going to ever happen. We didn’t come to Yale to do less; we came to be the best.
But as our schedules become tighter and the risk of feelings of inadequacy and isolation grow larger, we don’t have to be passive. We can shift how we take in our surroundings. We need to throw away the concerns that scheduling our hangouts will feel artificial and fake. And we need to be more actively open even when we don’t feel those around us are being responsive.
Everybody wants to talk to us. Always.
The Yale Daily News often discharges its mission responsibly. However, in reporting on Yale’s endowment, the News frequently fails to meet fundamental journalistic standards.
Consider “Inside Yale’s $27,000,000,000,” a Feb. 3 teach-in sponsored by a number of activist groups. In their presentation, a question appears in white letters on a black background: “So what is Yale invested in?” The answers: “Mass Incarceration” and the “Private Prison Industry.”
Quite simply stated, Yale’s endowment has no exposure to private prison management companies. Where does the activists’ assertion come from? The activists note that a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on March 31, 2017, discloses Yale’s holdings of $345 million in Vanguard’s Emerging Markets Exchange Traded Fund, VWO. Observing that Vanguard is the largest holder of private prison companies GEO and CoreCivic, the activists imply that Yale has exposure to the companies through VWO. This assertion is completely untrue.
VWO invests in stocks of companies located in emerging markets. The private prison companies cited by activists as Vanguard holdings, GEO and CoreCivic, are headquartered in the United States. That inconvenient fact failed to deter the activists from making a dishonest argument.
The activists make a similarly flawed argument regarding a Sept. 30, 2017, SEC filing showing Yale holding $66 million in BlackRock’s iShares Exchange Traded Fund, EFA. EFA invests in developed markets outside the U.S. and Canada. Again, Yale is criticized for having positions in the domestic private prison industry. Again, the assertion is not true.
The fabricated story about Yale’s holdings in private prison companies prompted Charlie Urban-Mead ’19 to call University President Peter Salovey a “hypocrite” for supporting sensible immigration policies, while “profiting off of immigrant detention.” Urban-Mead and his cohort owe President Salovey an apology.
The News exacerbates the problem. In reporting on Yale’s endowment, the News ignores the journalistic imperatives of checking facts, providing context and maintaining balance. In the Feb. 5, 2018, article “Students Criticize University Investments At Teach-In,” the staff reporter simply serves as a mouthpiece for the activists. The reporter parrots the activists’ dishonest argument about Yale’s holdings in EFA and VWO.
Some might be inclined to forgive a reporter for making errors in the complex world of investments. The errors are difficult to forgive, however, when they are easily avoidable. First, the reporter should not serve as a megaphone for the activist arguments — the reporter gushes about “vibrant photos and precise figures.” Second, if the reporter does not understand something, the reporter should not write about it. Third, the reporter has a direct contact in the Investment Office, who is able to help with facts, context and balance. The reporter did not contact the Office before running the story. Finally, where was the editor? Should not the editor identify nonsensical paragraphs, lack of context and extreme bias?
By failing to do real reporting, the Yale Daily News misses an opportunity to address important questions. For example, do measurable differences exist between conditions in public and private prisons? As contractors for public authorities, do private prison companies bear responsibility for prison conditions or does responsibility rest with the contracting government entity? Are union activists motivated by concern for prisoners or by dislike for the largely nonunion labor force in private prisons as compared to the largely union labor work force in public prisons?
News reporting on the activist presentation painted a dark picture of Yale’s endowment.
The Feb. 5 article is one piece of a longstanding problem. In recent years, the News failed to report fairly not only on the issue of private prisons, but also on the issues of Puerto Rican debt, fossil fuels and Northern Pass. The Yale community deserves better.
In the more than three decades that I have managed Yale’s endowment, the honesty of the activists and the reporting of the News have deteriorated. The problems began more than a decade ago with a well-financed campaign, conducted first by GESO, then by Local 33, to “investigate” Yale’s investment activities. Many of the false and misleading stories generated by the union were carried by the News without careful thought and without adequate fact checking.
I am proud of the work that my colleagues and I do to support Yale. In every aspect of everything that we do every day, we operate with the highest ethical and fiduciary standards.
Readers of the Yale Daily News deserve to know the full story.

Editor’s note, March 1: The News takes this criticism very seriously. We are looking into Mr. Swensen’s claims and will run corrections to our stories as needed. The News strives to report responsibly and accurately on campus issues, including Yale’s endowment. The News is always open to publishing criticism of our work in hopes of facilitating constructive conversations with readers about our coverage and mission. However, Swensen has not agreed to an on-the-record interview with the News. While our reporters are trained to cover every side of important campus debates, that task becomes more difficult when one side refuses to explain its position.
The online version of this Op-Ed contains a statement by Swensen that the News originally did not publish because it is incorrect. He writes that the reporter did not contact Yale’s Investments Office before the publication of the Feb. 5 story, when in fact the reporter did.
If my residential college affiliation were calculated by where I eat my meals, I’d be one third LiMur, one third Hoplite and one third Sillimander. The catch? I’m a Stilesian, loyal to the land of brick pizza ovens and hungry athletes.
While I love Stiles, we’ve been the catalyst for some poorly crafted trends. In 1785, Ezra Stiles created the first grading system, recording in his diary that 12 of his students were “Inferiores.” Sometime before 2018, the Stiles dining hall began restricting dining hall hours, preventing students of other residential colleges from accessing our famed brick pizza ovens between the hours of 5:00 and 6:30 p.m.
With the recent closings of Silliman and Hopper, this trend is creating more problems than solutions.
Let me be clear — I don’t mean to make a mountain out of a molehill. Yale students could easily eat at different times or go to different dining halls. It’s not about the inconvenience of walking an extra five minutes or eating dinner 30 minutes earlier. Rather, it’s about the impact that this has on community at Yale and intercollege relationships. Yale is based on community. It’s the foundation of this college and what differentiates us from other universities. Anything that threatens that, even marginally, is worth discussing.
There are two reasons why the impact on Yale’s community will be more than just marginal. The first is that the mass of people who used to eat in Hopper and Silliman will now just move to other central colleges, like Jonathan Edwards and Branford — Saybrook not included, for obvious reasons. The second is that this shift will lead those colleges to adopt similar dining hall restrictions. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that we could all end up having to eat dinner in our own colleges every night, unless we have the honor of being the sole guest of someone who lives elsewhere.
So, why does this matter? A key reason why Hopper and Silliman limited transfer hours is to protect community within their own colleges. But for most of us, dinner is the only time when we can see friends who aren’t in our colleges or classes. As the school year progresses, breakfast devolves into eating a granola bar on the Blue Line and lunch is converted into the beep of a Durfee’s swipe. That leaves dinner. For many of us, there’s a quiet joy in sitting down with a handful of friends in the dining hall, letting time tick by. There’s also a beauty in the diversity that Hopper and Silliman embody during those hours: They become places where you can encounter those from all over the Yale community, who you’d never see otherwise. In the last three days, that energy has chilled into a cold calmness.
That isn’t to say that community within Hopper and Silliman don’t matter. They do. What I’m saying is that no college should close to transfers, because community will forge on regardless. Butteries, libraries and gyms are still private spaces, college-only events will still run and, at the very least, everyone will still live together. If anything, Berkeley closing led to overcrowding in Hopper. It’s a domino effect. Eventually, it’ll all topple.
This change also disproportionately hurts those in Timothy Dwight, Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. Most campus events happen around Cross Campus. If a student in Franklin wants to grab dinner in Silliman on their way to section in WLH after working in the CEID all day, they can’t anymore. They now have to choose between walking to Trumbull or Branford to eat or going back to Franklin. And it gets worse. If this trend continues, it becomes a nightmare for those who are relegated to colleges away from the center of campus, people who are either hurt by random assignment or lack legacy status to choose otherwise. It also makes it harder for these students to grab meals with groups of friends or extracurriculars, because people are unwilling to make the trek up to Franklin and Murray.
I don’t blame Hopper and Silliman for closing to transfers. The onus is not on them to fix the problem of overcrowding in dining halls, it’s on Yale’s administration. It’s the administration’s responsibility to protect community at Yale, whether that’s through shifting dining hours later — very few of us eat from 5 to 5:45 p.m. — or acknowledging that dinner at Commons could’ve alleviated this problem.
By 2021, we will have 800 more students than usual on campus than we did before the new colleges opened. If Yale’s administration can’t successfully manage the first slew of 200 that we added to this year’s incoming first-year class, then the fabric of Yale’s community will slowly unravel, through more than just dining halls. And trust me, there are few things that people have more in common than our need to eat.
It’s 9 p.m. on a Wednesday evening, and I’m sitting across from a friend in the Trumbull library. The narrow room is toasty and dimly lit as usual, and she and I are typing furiously — not essays or columns, but text messages. After a few largely nonsensical exchanges, I send her this message: “why did i come here to ‘work’ when really we’re just typing messages to each other in the silent sanctity of this WORKING SPACE while side-eyeing each other,” which elicits a snort on her behalf — oh, I’m sorry, a soft chuckle, she would never snort. Then I — gently, lovingly — mute her and we both get back to our assignments, like perfectly focused Yale students.
But if I’m being honest with myself, a few minutes of unwinding are much-needed in my life. This past week has been a series of unwanted late nights, unexpected emotional debacles and expected — but draining — exams, writing assignments and lab reports. As of this moment in the Trumbrary, I’ve finally returned to equilibrium — and I’m basking in how good it feels to be in full control of my calendar again. And yet, this sense of relief makes me wonder why I cling so strongly to the illusion of control. Perhaps this desire has always been a part of me, not so deep down in my anal personality, but something about college has made me crave it more than ever. I don’t spend enough time pondering the extent to which it has consumed my life.
Put simply, I lack flexibility. Off-kilter, spontaneous moments bring a thrill, followed by a pulse of anxiety. I am more comfortable with plans. Routines. Premeditation. I won’t dismiss the significant benefits of perfectionism — that cute little drive that keeps my problem sets neat and ensures the satisfaction of my TAs — but I will ask this: What is the goal of all of this focus and order? If the true reason that I work so hard Monday through Friday is so I can do what I really want to do — lie in bed, skip town to NYC or send ridiculous streams of texts to my friends — then why am I putting any of that off until the weekend? Or worse, until after I graduate? Or even worse, until after I retire?
I’m not going to go into depth about Yale’s maddening dedication to overachievement and ignorance of individual limitations, because we talk about that all the time and nothing has changed. But there should be a limit to setting professional priorities, and buying into Yale culture has enabled me to take it too far. Stockholm syndrome — when it comes to work, extracurriculars, jobs and party life — is a verifiable epidemic at Yale.
The cure is not taking more classes or fewer classes. It is not making more friends or fewer friends. It is not eating more or less Stiles pizza on a rainy Thursday night. There is no singular cure, because the issue has no singular root. Perhaps the cure, more broadly, is simply the opposite of perfectionism: taking time for ourselves in different, unplanned, messy ways, and rejecting the toxic perspectives that we have on free time — napping isn’t a waste of an afternoon. Spending an hour in the dining hall isn’t lazing around. Taking fewer classes isn’t a missed opportunity. Going to New York over the weekend isn’t just escapism — in fact, in some realm far outside of our preprofessional lives, taking the day off is just called living.
The cure is change and knowing when change is needed. If implementing the same study habit again and again has exhausted you beyond caring, admit that you need to try something different. After all, even though each shopping period leads to a new course schedule, this is negated if you fall into the same emotional or psychological ruts as always. I, for one, cannot afford to eschew freedom for the sake of routines and order — not when I have many years of schooling ahead of me and at least 45 years before retirement.
While I don’t think that we should abandon every study habit or coffee shop we’ve ever frequented, I do think that little bits of active change can do a lot for tired, bored Yale souls. If we could all take a moment to separate ourselves from the negative mindset that keeps us from having the freedom to do what we really want, maybe we could all improve our lives. So, make that bucket list, take those risks or stop taking so many risks. The cure will not come naturally; we have to want it and pursue it, sometimes just by sending silly texts in the Trumbrary.
Even if we weren’t raised in a particularly religious household or community, it’s conventional wisdom that lying is bad. We castigate politicians and lawyers for being dishonest, and even the whitest of lies can forever ruin a relationship. In my “Age of Hamilton and Jefferson” class, we learned that calling someone a liar in the 18th century almost always resulted in a duel. A person’s life was only worth the value of their word, and today, even though it might not be worth dying over, we highly value a person’s reputation as “honest.”
I too strive to be honest. But in recent days, reflecting on what my honesty has cost me and on how other people’s honesty has affected me, I’ve concluded that there has to be more nuance to honesty: Can honesty have more “nuance” and still be considered honesty at all? Does honesty pay, or are we stuck in the world of our childhoods, when life was black or white, when telling the truth was good and to lying was bad? These questions aren’t novel to me, as I’ve considered them for a while now.
For example, in my first year, I walked through Phelps Gate as a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed lamb, still faithful to the ideal of honesty and openness. But after experiences writing for the News, covering a Supreme Court Justice and talking with my “Quantitative Foundations of Microeconomics” professor, I soon questioned whether I’d be able to leave Yale as innocent and idealistic as I had entered it.
We constantly make decisions about whether or not to be honest. One morning I received an email saying, “Flash Pitch: Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer will be at the law school tomorrow at 9 a.m. to talk about the rule of law. Reply all to claim!” Without hesitation, I responded to the email within the same minute that I had received it. It was unreal to think that the first article I wrote for the News would be about a Supreme Court justice. But just a few minutes later, as soon as the initial excitement began to wear off, I realized that I had signed up for this assignment when I had an econ problem solving session that same morning. But this concern too passed away within a matter of minutes — who would pick a problem-solving session over a chance to meet and interact with a justice?
Breyer did not disappoint, and I was confident that I had made the right decision, but I had to email my econ professor about my absence. I resolved to tell the truth, because I was sure she would understand. I was going to a talk featuring a justice, after all.
Alas, she did not understand. She informed me that she was glad that I had had “a good educational experience” but that I had “missed the pop quiz which could not be made up.” Adding insult to injury, she reminded me that, “part of a Yale education is learning to choose among the many interesting and valuable educational experiences at any point in time and evaluating their opportunity cost.” “Have a good weekend!” she added as an afterthought. I couldn’t help but laugh at the entire thing, lest I cry over my naivete. Things only got worse, and I ended up dropping the class.
I still struggle with these questions about honesty. Just a few weeks ago, I was at dinner with a friend when I told her that an aspect of the conversation we were having bothered me. She burst into tears, and I felt like a jerk — even though my honesty wasn’t a character attack, it essentially had the same effect as one. And a few days ago, a different friend was brutally honest when working with me on a problem set. He said, “I hope I never have kids that are as bad at math as you are.” I don’t blame him, but it was still hurtful.
So, where does that leave us? Should we jettison honesty in the name of kindness and courtesy, in the name of going along in life without causing more problems for ourselves? I’m inclined to say yes, but there’s something to be said for the temporary pain that honesty causes. Sometimes, this pain can pre-emptively solve issues that we can face down the road, that can tell you that you a class or a professor isn’t really for you, that a friend may not really be a friend after all. Honesty is a double-edged sword, so consider that the next time you hold something back.
